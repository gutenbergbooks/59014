<p>The 125th Annual Meeting of “<span class="smcap">The Pennsylvania Prison
Society</span>” was held January 11th, 1912, at the office of the Society,
S. W. Corner Fifth and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, the President,
<span class="smcap">Joshua L. Baily</span>, in the Chair.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight members of the Society were present.</p>

<p>The Minutes of the 124th Annual Meeting were read and
approved.</p>

<p>The Report of the Acting Committee was read by the Secretary.
The report was approved and was directed to be printed
in the “<span class="smcap">Journal</span>.” (See page 6)</p>

<p>The Treasurer, <span class="smcap">John Way</span>, produced a detailed statement

shall be residents of Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“These Members may be elected from time to time at any
meeting of the Acting Committee, according to the provisions of
the By-Laws for filling vacancies, but the terms for which they
are elected shall be for the unexpired portion of the current fiscal
year only. These additional Members will be eligible for re-election
at the next Annual Meeting, and their respective terms
of service shall then be assigned so as to be co-ordinate with the
terms of service of the other Members of the Committee.”</p>

<p>The President spoke in acknowledgment of the honor of his
re-election to the Presidency of this Society, the oldest organization
of the kind in the world. He congratulated the Society on
the increased interest as manifested by the attendance at this

<h2 id="REPORT_OF_THE_ACTING_COMMITTEE_FOR_THE">REPORT OF THE ACTING COMMITTEE FOR THE
YEAR 1911.</h2>

<p>In the year 1912, the <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania Prison Society</span> will
have completed a century and a quarter of its existence. It seems
opportune briefly to note some of the important features of the
work of this organization during the last 125 years. We are
fortunate in the possession of an unbroken series of records of
the transactions of this body from its first meeting in May, 1787,
to the present time.</p>

<p>In 1787 the conditions of the jails in Philadelphia were unspeakably
disgraceful. In one common herd there were kept by
day and by night prisoners of all ages, colors, degrees of crime,
and the sexes were not separated. No bedding was supplied and
unless the prisoner had means or friends, he slept on the ground
or bare floor. One loaf of bread constituted the daily ration.
Misconduct was punished by the branding-iron, the pillory, or by
the lash. Intoxicants were sold to all applicants who had money.
The keeper reaped a profit from all sales made to the inmates of
the prison. The death rate was enormous. No effort was made
to find any useful employment for the prisoners.</p>

<p>The Society early resolved that intoxicants must be forbidden
and that some form of employment must be found. They insisted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
on segregation of the sexes, and also began to press for individual
separation in order that the penal institutions should not
become schools for crime. Within a very few years many reforms
were instituted. The death penalty which had been inflicted
for a score of crimes was abrogated except for murder in
the first degree. “Solitary confinement to hard labor” is still a
familiar phrase used by Judges in pronouncing sentence. In its
early years, the Society consistently and persistently urged the
adoption of a system of employment whereby each prisoner alone
in his cell should perform his task in some industrial pursuit. It
was never intended that the prisoners should be kept entirely secluded
from all human companionship, but that the officers should
see them frequently and that concerned visitors, under proper
supervision, should be allowed to talk with them and endeavor to
point them to the better way. This idea became known among
penologists as “The Pennsylvania System,” and was discussed
widely, both at home and abroad. The Eastern Penitentiary, on
Fairmount Avenue, formerly Coates Street, was built upon plans
largely suggested by this Society. Doubtless the separate system
was entirely carried out in 1829, when the prison was opened for
the reception of prisoners. But in the last half century, the number
of prisoners has exceeded the number of cells, so that the
officers of the prison have not been able to carry out this system
as originally planned. When this penitentiary was first constructed,
it was located on what was then known as Cherry Hill,
an eminence in the Northwest suburban district, and was surrounded
by farming land. That penal institutions should be located
in the country is, therefore, not a new proposition. Now
it is generally conceded that such institutions not only should be
located in the country, but that they should own and work a large
tract of land adjacent.</p>

<p>The first prisoner was received Oct. 25, 1829. The first report of the
Committee to visit the Eastern Penitentiary was made to the Acting Committee
on Nov. 11, 1829, and shows that there were two prisoners at that
time in the institution, one a white man from Chester Co., the other a
colored man from Delaware Co. By June 8, 1830, the number of prisoners
had increased to 25. The following extracts from the report of the Visiting
Committee, made in June, 1830, will prove interesting to those who are
familiar with the present conditions at the Penitentiary. “* * * The
best order prevails among the prisoners who are industriously, and it is
believed, profitably employed. Each is supplied with a soup-pan, washbasin,
brush, fine and coarse tooth comb, spoon, knife and fork, and every
week with a clean towel. Each prisoner is required to keep his room
clean and neat. * * * The food consists of half a pint of milk, mixed
in the same amount of hot water, bread made of rye and Indian meal
(one pound) for breakfast; for dinner one pint soup, three-fourths pound
meat, one-third pound bread; for supper one pint Indian mush and a half
gill molasses. * * * No conversation can take place between the
prisoners, and no communication from without be permitted. It has not
been found necessary to inflict any punishment so far, except in two cases:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
in one case where a prisoner had neglected to keep his mess-pan clean,
he lost two meals; in another case, a prisoner who neglected his work was
for three days deprived of his meat. The principal trades are weaving
and shoemaking, trades which may be carried on in cells to advantage.
The health of the prisoners continues good.” The report is signed June
8, 1830, by the entire Visiting Committee consisting of David Weatherly
and James J. Barclay. Now after 80 years the supply of furniture is
practically the same, a table or stand being added. Sanitary arrangements
have been vastly improved, and the addition of a superior grade of homemade
wheat bread and coffee to the bill of fare has made a more palatable
menu.</p>

<p>Some forty years ago it was written that every advance in
the amelioration of convict prisons systems of discipline began in
Philadelphia. In the discussion of these problems <span class="smcap">The Pennsylvania
Prison Society</span> took a conspicuous part. In 1856 the first
published criticism of the contract system, under which the labor
of the prisoners was sold for profit and to meet the prison expenses,
issued from Philadelphia. The criticism was received
with scorn and ridicule. Thoughtful students of humanitarian
measures began investigations in one State after another, with the
result that at the present time scarcely one State in the Union
maintains such a system. But while Pennsylvania has led the way
in many measures to reform the criminal and improve his condition,
some States have made more rapid progress in these directions.
Many States offer greater opportunities in their prisons for
industrial employment than we can show in Pennsylvania. Most
of the States have preceded us in the adoption of a Parole and a
Probation system for adult convicts.</p>

<h3>PROBATION, PAROLE, INDETERMINATE SENTENCE.</h3>

<p>In 1909, the Legislature of Pennsylvania enacted a law providing
for Probation for some classes of adult offenders, and also
for a Parole of criminals sentenced to the Penitentiaries of the
State under the conditions of an Indeterminate Sentence. Under
the Probation Act, the Courts have power to suspend the imposition
of the sentence and to place the defendant on Probation on
such terms and conditions as the Court may deem proper.</p>

<p>The Parole Law applied to the sentences of criminals sentenced
to the Penitentiary on and after June 30, 1909. Two
Members of <span class="smcap">The Pennsylvania Prison Society</span> were very
active in framing this law and in securing its passage. The Legislature
of 1911 amended this law so as to render almost nugatory
some of the provisions of the law with regard to the Indeterminate
Sentence. The Chairman of our Committee on Legislation
has ably discussed this subject in an article published in the
<span class="smcap">Journal</span> which was issued in November, 1911. The following
statistics, furnished by Parole Officer, <span class="smcap">John McKenty</span>, of the
Eastern Penitentiary, show the operation of the law to the end
of the year 1911.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Number paroled since the law was effective</td>
    <td class="tdr">128</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Number returned for failure to fulfill requirement</td>

  </tr></table>

<p>These figures compare quite favorably with the results reported
from other States in which this system has been for a
longer period in vogue.</p>

<h3>THE EASTERN PENITENTIARY.</h3>

<p>Reports of the Members of the Acting Committee, appointed
to visit the Eastern Penitentiary, show that during the year 1911
6405 visits to prisoners have been made. Many unreported visits
have gladdened the prisoner in his lonely cell. Several of our
members participate in the Gospel services on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners remarked to the Secretary that in his
opinion the work of visitation was the most important function of
the Society. This has been the most effective part of our work
from the first. Some of the men’s blocks are not visited so often as
would be desirable. The women’s block is said to be over-visited.
Several organizations have the privilege of sending visitors to
the twenty-seven women now incarcerated, and while visitors
are welcomed at suitable times and under proper conditions,
yet it is readily recognized that these prisoners of the women’s
block should have sufficient time to attend to their regular, but not
onerous, duties as assistants in various lines of domestic employment.</p>

<p>Under the management of Warden <span class="smcap">Robert J. McKenty</span>,
the administration is to be commended. The discipline is firm,
but kindly, and so long as the privileges granted are not abused,
there is allowed a large amount of freedom within reasonable
limits. Hence, in this institution, the visitor may note an unusually
contented and orderly body of convicts.</p>

<h3>RELIEF FOR PRISONERS WHEN DISCHARGED.</h3>

<p>The expense of supplying needy prisoners with clothing at
the time of their discharge from the Eastern Penitentiary has
been almost entirely borne by this Society since 1896. For the
six years prior to 1896, the Legislature appropriated on the average
of $2490.00 annually to the Society, which thereupon assumed
the expense of providing outfits for the prisoners at the time of
their release. In 1895, the Governor refused to sanction the
appropriation. No legislative grant of funds has been made since
that time to the Society. Our late Honorary Secretary, <span class="smcap">John J.
Lytle</span>, who at that time was the General Secretary of the Society,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
with untiring energy solicited contributions from benevolent citizens
to supply the prisoners when released with presentable
clothing. His whole heart was in this work and nobly did he
discharge what he deemed to be his duty to administer the charity
in which our Society had been, up to that time, assisted by the
State. We are still providing an outfit for discharged prisoners,
although this aid is supplied by legislative appropriation practically
in every other State of the Union. I append to this report a
schedule showing what provision is made for prisoners at the
time of their discharge from the various State Prisons. (<a href="#Page_38">See
page 38</a>.)</p>

<p>During the year, 1911, the Secretary has furnished 370 men
at the time of their discharge from the Eastern Penitentiary
either with entire outfits, or with sufficient attire to make them
presentable.</p>

<p>The following list shows what garments have been given:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Coats</td>
    <td class="tdr">293</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vests</td>

    <td>Collars</td>
    <td class="tdr">41</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-left: 1em;">Total number of garments</td>
    <td class="tdr">2611</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>A few of the women on their discharge have been furnished
with suitable articles of apparel.</p>

<p>The administration of this charity is attended with peculiar
advantages. It is an important duty to visit the prisoners near
the close of their time of incarceration, and to learn from them
with regard to their hopes and fears. Then, if ever, they need
sympathetic attention. Many of them have friends or homes
ready to receive them, but there are others who need more than
a suit of clothes and a parting word of good wishes. We endeavor
to find employment for such as these unfortunate ones,
and, while in many cases we have succeeded, there is a remnant
who are not strong enough to face the temptations of the outer
world. Shall we not send such as these to a farm under control
of the State, where they will have opportunity to work in the
open air, and be retained in some kind of semi-detention until
they have made good?</p>

<h3>WESTERN PENITENTIARY.</h3>

<p>Two members of the Acting Committee, who reside in Pittsburg,
have reported various visits and some Gospel service in the
Western Penitentiary.</p>

<p>In response to an inquiry with regard to the provision made
for the prisoners of that institution at the time of their discharge,
Warden <span class="smcap">John Francies</span> writes as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">A. H. Votaw</span>, Secretary,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em">The Pennsylvania Prison Society,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 8em">Philadelphia, Pa.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Replying to your inquiry of Dec. 20, 1911, permit me to reply as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. With regard to money to prisoners on discharge.</p>

<p>This depends upon the distance the prisoner is going. If within a
radius of fifty miles, $5.00 is given. If outside the radius of fifty miles,
$10.00 is given.</p>

<p>2. With regard to clothing to prisoners on discharge.</p>

<p>The prisoner is given $10.00 worth of clothing as provided for in
appropriation by last session of Legislature.</p>

<p>3. Clothing supplied.</p>

<p>Suit complete, and furnishings, viz.: hat, shirt, shoes, hose, tie,
collar, etc.</p>

<p class="author">
<span style="padding-right: 8em">Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">John Francies</span>, <i>Warden</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>At the last session of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, authority
was granted to remove this prison from Allegheny City
to some large tract of land amid healthier surroundings, and we
have learned that a site has been selected about eight miles from
Bellefonte in Centre county. Full opportunity will be afforded
here to test the out-door treatment.</p>

<p>Chaplain <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, of the Western Penitentiary, has kindly
furnished the following statistics with regard to those paroled
from that institution:</p>

<h3>PHILADELPHIA COUNTY PRISONS.</h3>

<p>The Committee appointed to visit the Philadelphia County
Prisons have been diligent in this service and the reports show
that 6100 visits have been made to the prisoners at Moyamensing
and Holmesburg.</p>

<p>The General Agent, <span class="smcap">Fred. J. Pooley</span>, has assisted several
hundred at the time of their discharge with lodging, clothing,
railroad fares, and with articles to sell, while they are awaiting
more permanent employment. He has given help to a considerable
number in securing situations. The Door of Blessing has indeed
proved to be true to its name in giving help to the women at the
time of their discharge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<h3>GENERAL AGENT.</h3>

<p>Our General Agent, <span class="smcap">Fred. J. Pooley</span>, has found a large
field for service at the Central Police Station at City Hall. He
makes a special object to have interviews with those who have
had a preliminary hearing before Magistrates, and who have
been committed for trial before the Judges at City Hall. More
than a thousand letters has he written in behalf of those who have
been arrested in the last year. Very often he secures the release
of young prisoners by promptly communicating with parents
or relatives, who assume responsibility for the offender. Thus
many first offenders are turned from the error of their ways by
this timely attention, and escape the schooling in crime which
they would inevitably receive by further association with hardened
criminals. The work requires to be done with the utmost tact
and discretion, and several of the Magistrates have borne testimony
to the efficient service of our General Agent. He has
presented a more detailed report, an abstract of which will be
printed in the “<span class="smcap">Journal</span>.”</p>

<h3>COUNTY PRISONS (OUTSIDE OF PHILADELPHIA.)</h3>

<p>Members of our Acting Committee have reported visits
to the prisons in Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery,
Monroe, Lancaster and Westmoreland and other counties.
With the passage of the proposed amendment to our Constitution,
providing for additions to the Acting Committee, it
will be possible to secure workers in other counties of the State,
who, we trust, will be of material assistance in collecting information,
and also in co-operating with us to secure measures to
ameliorate some of the evils of the present system. There are
very few county jails in the State whose construction and management
may be regarded as creditable. Some of the officials
are doubtless doing the best they can with the means at hand.
But the great majority of jails throughout the State have made
little progress in the last half century. “No prison without employment”
should be our campaign cry. It ought not to be impracticable
for a number of the smaller counties to unite in
the management of a prison farm to which petty offenders should
be sent. Such a farm should be self-supporting.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten that the State of Pennsylvania
has at least two institutions which for some years have illustrated
the value and efficacy of farm life for prisoners. One
is the Huntingdon Reformatory, the other is the Allegheny Work
House at Hoboken.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN PRISON CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>Since our <span class="smcap">Journal</span> for 1911 was issued so late in that year,
it gave opportunity to include in its contents an account of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Proceedings of the American Prison Association, which met in
Omaha, Nebraska, in October, 1911. This report was prepared
by the secretary of the Society, who was appointed Delegate to
the Association. <span class="smcap">Deborah C. Leeds</span> was also present at the
sessions of this body. In 1912, the Association will be held
in Baltimore, Maryland, and we hope a considerable number
of the members of our Society will attend its sessions.</p>

<h3>ASSISTANT SECRETARY.</h3>

<p>By motion of the Acting Committee passed in June, 1911,
<span class="smcap">Dr. William C. Stokes</span> was appointed Assistant to the Secretary.
His duties have been to assist in the clerical work of the
office, and especially to endeavor to increase the amount of
funds collected for the use of the Society. Since his appointment,
the office has been kept open during the greater part of the business
hours of each day, and we have felt there was an important
service in having the office accessible at all time to members
and visitors. Since June 21st, a Register for Visitors has been
kept, and the record shows that 417 visitors had registered to
December 31st from 35 States. A few foreign visitors were
received. Many of these visitors appear to appreciate information
about the work in which we are engaged, and they generally accept
some of our publications. We believe this opportunity to
present some features of our work will prove of some value.</p>

<h3>OBITUARIES.</h3>

<p>During the year 1911, the Acting Committee lost by death
three of its members.</p>

<p>On Eighth Month 18, our beloved Honorary Secretary,
John J. Lytle, passed away from his residence at Moorestown,
N. J.</p>

<p>On Second Month, 15, Miss Mary S. Whelen, formerly
a very active and efficient member of the Active Committee,
died at her home in this city.</p>

<p>On Seventh Month 1, Robert P. Nicholson, a new, but deeply
interested, member died, as the result of an accident.</p>

<p>Appropriate notices of these valued members appeared in
our <span class="smcap">Journal</span> of October, 1911.</p>

<h3>THE SCOPE OF OUR WORK.</h3>

<p>In 1787, the labors of the Founders of our organization
were confined to the prisons of Philadelphia. It was but a few
years when they found it necessary, in order to accomplish certain
reformatory measures, to petition the Legislature for some
changes in, or additions to, the penal code. As time passed
their interest extended beyond the limits of Philadelphia, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
it was almost a hundred years after the founding of the Society
that its name was changed from “The Philadelphia Society
for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons” to “<span class="smcap">The Pennsylvania
Prison Society</span>.” Our interests are State-wide, and
in furtherance of this, the Membership of the Acting Committee
has recently been increased by the election of other interested
citizens residing in counties outside of Philadelphia, thus enlarging
the sphere of our influence. For many years, the Society
has had the valuable services on its Acting Committee of two
members from Pittsburg and several from counties adjacent to
Philadelphia, but closer relations with the prison work in all parts
of the State are much to be desired.</p>

<p>Our Master said, “I was in prison and ye came unto me.”
In the spirit of the Master, let us endeavor to impress in the
name of humanity, all well-disposed people everywhere to lend
a helping hand to their brothers and sisters who have been overtaken
by a fault.</p>

<h2 id="DEATH_OF_ROBERT_B_ADAMS">DEATH OF ROBERT B. ADAMS.</h2>

<p>Robert B. Adams, a former member of the Acting Committee
of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, who resigned in the
autumn of 1911, on his removal from the city to accept the Secretaryship
of the Y. M. C. A. at Rochester, N. Y., died Jan. 18,
1912, after a short illness from pneumonia. He was a genial
man of broad sympathies, and his loss will be felt by a large
circle of friends and by a host of unfortunates by whose ministrations
they had received help and inspiration.

<p class="table">
To the Acting Committee of The Pennsylvania Prison Society:<br />
</p>

<p>With the close of another year, your General Agent takes
pleasure in making the following report:</p>

<p>Regular visits have been made to the Eastern Penitentiary
and all the prisoners received at the institution during the year
were visited, and with the consent of the officials I have written
letters to relatives of many of the prisoners, some of whom
had not written home for years.</p>

<p>Regular visits have been made to Moyamensing Prison and
to Philadelphia County Prison at Holmesburg. Over 6,000 prisoners
have been visited and more than 600 assisted with room
rent, board and lodging, railroad tickets, tools, car-fare and employment,
etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>Your General Agent has made daily visits to the Central
Police Courts and to the cells at City Hall. During the year,
1911, 1,238 letters were written by him to relatives and friends
of those under arrest, by whose assistance or advice, bail was
secured in many cases, and in other cases a discharge was obtained.
During the month of December, 181 letters were written
at City Hall, as follows:</p>

<p>I will mention a few of the cases to show the importance of
the work of the Agent at City Hall.</p>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;A young man from Martinsburg, W. Va., arrested for being
on the streets without a home; the Magistrate held him for ten days to
give me an opportunity to look into the case. I learned that he had been
from home eighteen months. I wrote to his family and obtained his
discharge. He wrote on his arrival home:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“My dear friend Mr. Pooley:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>“I arrived home safe last evening at 6.30 P. M., and was met
by my father at the station. My father, mother and sister welcomed
me at home and even my little dog also. I just arrived in time,
thanks to you, for my folks were about to move to Mexico City,
Mexico.</p>

<p class="author">
“Thanking you for your great kindness to me,<br />
“Very truly yours,”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;A young man from New York left home without consent
of his relatives&mdash;found himself stranded in Philadelphia&mdash;was arrested and
given ten days in County Prison. I wrote to his mother, who came on to
this city and obtained his discharge.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Case of a woman arrested for spending her evenings in
Broad Street Station. I questioned her closely and found that because of
an unkind word with her sister, she left home and spent her evenings
in the Station, not having anywhere else to go. She told me who she was
and where her sister lived; I visited the sister, who was delighted to know
her sister was found. We obtained her discharge and she went home.</p>

<p>No. 4.&mdash;Two young men charged with larceny from a department
store. At the request of the Magistrate, I investigated the case and found
the young men were from New York City; at once a letter was sent to
their people; father came on; the charge was withdrawn; the boys discharged
and their father took them home.</p>

<p>No. 5.&mdash;A young man from Louisiana arrested for stealing; said
he had nothing to eat for three days; was committed for court; said
he would not disgrace his family as his father had a nice business in the
South, but he would not tell his address. During his conversation, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
told me his father came to Philadelphia twice a year to buy goods, and
mentioned one of the places where he bought them. I went to the place
he mentioned and found his father was then in the city; I left a note
asking him to meet me. He did so, and was deeply touched to learn
where his son was. He at once went to the prison and took an attorney
with him, and when the case came to court his son was discharged, and
he went home with his father.</p>

<p>No. 6.&mdash;A young man from Massachusetts charged with robbing, who
told me he had not written home for six years. I wrote to his father,
who was delighted to know that the lost son had been found. When the
case came to court, the young man was discharged and he went home
with his father.</p>

<p>The cases mentioned are only a few of the many, but they
indicate the character and importance of the work of the General
Agent at The Central Police Station.</p>

<p>While visiting the cells in the Central Station, City Hall,
I always feel a great responsibility resting upon me. I feel that
a word spoken in kindness and love may awaken thoughts of
the days of innocence and inspire them to endeavor to regain
what they had lost.</p>

<p>The officials of the City Hall have been very helpful to me
in doing all they can to help along the work. I deeply appreciate
their kindly services.</p>

<p>“Sabbath Reading” has been distributed weekly through the
personal efforts of our late friend, John J. Lytle. The subscriptions
to this useful and appreciated magazine will expire in
March, 1912, per annum. Something over $100 is needed to renew
the subscription and I trust that way may open for the continuance
of this benefaction.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to many of our friends for magazines and
papers for the prisoners.</p>

<p>During the past year Emlen Hutchinson, Esq., Chairman
of Board of Inspectors, Philadelphia Prison, has kindly sent me
$80.00 for the purpose of sending home runaway boys, a donation
of great usefulness.</p>

<h2 id="ENFORCE_IDLENESS_OF_PRISONERS">ENFORCE IDLENESS OF PRISONERS</h2>

<p>The law of Pennsylvania limits to thirty-five per cent. of
the whole number of convicts, those who may be employed in
any of the trades; as a consequence, the greater number of them
are consigned to enforced idleness. No punishment could be
more severe, and if punishment is the chief object of our penal
system, it is certainly secured by Pennsylvania law. It is a system,
however, which belongs to an age long since past, when
the reformation of the criminal had little or no consideration.</p>

<p>It is proper that an evil-doer should suffer punishment and
that society should be protected from his evil ways, but humanity
and Christianity alike require that at the same time that he is
subject to the restraints of the law, the wisest efforts should be
made for his improvement and reformation, the correction of
his evil propensities, and the formation of good habits, to the
intent that when the prison gates are opened to him he may
have a fair chance to become an upright and useful citizen.</p>

<p>This end cannot be attained by keeping the convict in idleness,
the most fruitful source of immorality and mental and
physical degeneracy. This law of enforced idleness is not only
cruel and inhuman, as to the convict, it is improvident as to the
State, for the convict, if employed, could not only earn a large
part, if not the entire cost of his maintenance, and thus relieve
the community of this burden, but he would be able to lift another
and greater burden which must rest somewhere, the support of
his family during his imprisonment.</p>

<p>Under the present system the guilty convict is not the chief
sufferer. The severity of the punishment falls heaviest upon
his family&mdash;the innocent wife and children.</p>

<h3>UNWISE AND VICIOUS.</h3>

<p>Is it not surprising that legislators who are responsible for
this compulsory idleness do not see its unwisdom and viciousness?</p>

<p>Instead of permitting the convict to earn his maintenance
by his own labor, a fellow-laborer outside the prison walls is
taxed to support him in idleness, an idleness which only intensifies
whatever criminal propensities he possesses, instead of curing
them, and increases his capacity for depredations upon society
when the prison doors are open to him.</p>

<p>In other words, for every man within prison walls who does
not earn his maintenance, some man outside has to earn it for
him. The Divine decree, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat thy bread,” is reversed in the case of the man who eats his
bread in the sweat of some other man’s face.</p>

<h2 id="THE_PHILADELPHIA_COUNTY_PRISON_AT">THE PHILADELPHIA COUNTY PRISON AT
HOLMESBURG.</h2>

<p>The Philadelphia County Prison, located at Holmesburg, between
the Philadelphia and New York Railroad and Torresdale
Avenue, about 6 miles north of the City Hall, and known as
the new jail, was erected some 15 years ago. It occupies a
plot of land containing about 21 acres. The wall which encloses
the buildings sets back from the outer line of the property about
30 feet, so that the acreage of the interior is about 18 acres.
The stone walls are 35 feet in height above ground and 12 feet
under the surface, so that the entire height of the masonry is
47 feet. The wall is 6 feet wide at the top and about twice that
width at the base, and entirely enclosing four sides of the tract.
The cost of this wall, including labor and materials, was $835,000.</p>

<p>In the center of the building is a rotunda 80 feet in width
and about 70 feet in height, surmounted by a lantern. From
this center six one-story corridors, or blocks, radiate like the
spokes of a wheel. These vary somewhat in length, but average
about 330 feet, and there is an average of about 70 cells in each.
The floor space of each cell is 8×18 feet and the ceiling height
is 13 feet, surmounted by a skylight. Of these corridors, A, B,
C, and D are occupied by white prisoners, and two of the corridors,
E and F, by colored. The number of prisoners at this
date, February 1st, 1912, is 715, about ninety less than at this
time last year. About 60 per cent. are white and 40 per cent.
colored. All the prisoners are men. All women convicts are
sent to the Moyamensing Prison.</p>

<p>The total number of cells is 440, and usually each cell is
occupied by two prisoners. Every cell is provided with a wash
basin with running water, a closet, two iron bedsteads, a table
and one or two stools. Each bedstead is provided with a mattress
stuffed with 25 pounds of hand-picked corn husks and a
7-pound pillow of the same material. Beside a pair of sheets
and pillow cases each prisoner has two 4-pound blankets of excellent
quality.</p>

<p>When a prisoner enters he undergoes a careful examination
and a very complete record is made of all his personal
characteristics. He then goes to the bathing room. An entirely
new suit of clothing is given him, and the clothing with which
he entered the prison is tied up in a sack, to which his name
is attached by a tag. The sack is then placed in a room provided
for that purpose, where it remains until his discharge from
the jail.</p>

<p>Wednesday and Thursday are bathing days, and each
prisoner is required to take a bath at least once a week unless
the physician certifies that the condition of the prisoner’s health
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
would render bathing inexpedient. A change of bedding and
underclothing is supplied to each prisoner on every Saturday.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_020a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Office of Administration, Philadelphia County Prison for Convicts, at Holmesburg</span></p>
</div>

<p>About 200 of the prisoners are employed in various trades,
in carpentering 7, on tin work 2, making mattresses 2, as tailors
14, shoemakers 20, making brushes 10. These all occupy
separate apartments. In one additional apartment there are 15
hand looms, on which are made the muslin used for sheets,
etc. About 18 men are employed in connection with this weaving.
There are in the same apartment 24 stocking weaving machines,
employing one man each. About 20 find employment in the
laundry, and beside these there are about 70 men employed in
various duties, to wit: 14 men in cooking, 14 in the bake house,
6 in the boiler room, etc. The men employed in these various
engagements have their meals in a dining room apart from the
other prisoners, a room having 6 tables, seating 12 each.</p>

<p>The kitchen for this great establishment is a very spacious
one and very complete and convenient in all its appointments.
There are 6 large steam heated copper boilers intended for making
soups. In these boilers 250 gallons of soup are made per
day during 4 days of the week and an equal quantity of what is
known as Irish stew on the other 3 days. The basis of the soup
and stew is fresh beef or mutton.</p>

<p>From 700 to 800 pounds of fresh meat is furnished to the
jail every day and is hung in a cold storage room, ready for use
as wanted. There is in addition another storage room in which
are stored a great quantity of canned tomatoes, barrels of rice,
barley, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The bakery is also very spacious with 4 arched ovens and
4 kneading troughs. Eight barrels of flour are converted into
bread every day, excepting on Sunday, a double quantity being
baked on Saturday. The number of loaves baked averages about
900 daily, the weight of each being 2 pounds, this being a proportion
of something more than one loaf a day to each prisoner,
and it is worth while to add that the bread is uniformly baked
and of unimpeachable quality.</p>

<p>Still another large room is used for the production of
chocolate and what is called coffee. It is necessary to state that
no coffee is used, but the article which passes by that name is
rye, which is roasted and ground and boiled in copper boilers;
25 pounds of this material is used every morning and suffices
to furnish about 3 half pints to each prisoner.</p>

<p>An equal quantity of chocolate is furnished for the supper.
A dessert of prunes is furnished each prisoner on every Friday.</p>

<p>The boiler room, some 30×80 feet in dimensions, requires
the attention of 6 men, and from this room an extensive system
of steam piping permeates every portion of the buildings and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
furnishes the power for the engine and for the electric lighting.
Electric lights are throughout all the premises, including each
cell.</p>

<p>An ample supply of filtered water is furnished by the
Holmesburg and Tacony Water Co., for which the jail pays $2,000
per annum.</p>

<p>The city had under consideration a proposal to purchase
this water company, but the price at which it was valued, $146,000,
seemed to the authorities too high.</p>

<p>There are in the prison at this date 9 cases of tuberculosis.
These occupy cells entirely apart from the other prisoners, cells
which open out on one side to the open air. The patients have
liberty within and without, as their own pleasure and convenience
suggests, and when the weather is suitable most of their
time is spent in walking or lounging in the prison yard. Besides
this, there are but few cases of sickness in the prison at this
time.</p>

<p>Up to within a recent period, the prisoners all wore striped
clothing, but on June 1st of last year this mark of distinction
was abolished and the prisoners were all given new suits free
from any distinctive mark. The striped clothing is now worn
only as a punishment for misdemeanor and for which purpose
there has been so far only little occasion. The exhibition of a
suit of striped clothing to a prisoner or the mere mention of a
possibility of his being compelled to wear one, has been found
sufficient in most cases to subdue and bring the most obdurate
prisoners to terms.</p>

<p>There is a library of about 5,000 volumes. Each prisoner
being furnished with a catalogue is permitted to select as many
as 2 or 3 books a week, the keepers often kindly assisting in
making suitable selections. Two or three men are constantly
employed in the care of the library and in rebinding the books,
which become much soiled or in need of rebinding.</p>

<p>There are religious services in each corridor on Sunday
afternoon, and at the close of that service the choir of colored
men, numbering about 20, give sacred singing from the center
of the rotunda, much to the enjoyment of the prisoners, all of
whom can hear distinctly, even from the farthest extremity of
the corridors.</p>

<p>A very interesting and commendable condition of the
Holmesburg Jail is that the use of tobacco is prohibited. This
prohibition includes the use of chewing or smoking tobacco or
cigars, and extends not to the prisoners only, but to all the
keepers. It is said that although this is a hard experience to
a large majority of the prisoners on entering, they soon adapt
themselves to it, and from the standpoint of health are undoubtedly
better off for this abstinence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>The entire cost of the maintenance of this jail after deducting
about $5000 each year for sales of manufactured articles
or of waste materials, is a little less than $100,000, which
money is appropriated by City Councils.</p>

<p>If the chief aim in the erection of this prison was to secure
a place of confinement from which there would be but the remotest
possibility of escape, the end has certainly been attained,
but no one could go through the buildings and observe their
harmonious and intelligent adaptation to all requirements without
the conviction that the health and physical comfort of the
prisoners had been made the chief consideration. The visitor,
however, will have much occasion for dissatisfaction on finding
that the majority of the convicts are <i>without employment</i>, but
this is no fault of the Inspectors, who are charged with the administration
of the affairs of the prison; the law of the State
is at fault in that it limits to 35 per cent. of the whole number
of convicts those who may be employed in any of the trades,
and, as a consequence, the greater number of men are compelled
to remain idle.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this very much to be regretted condition,
too much cannot be said of the good order and effective discipline
which prevails at the Holmesburg Prison. A striking
example of that was had at the time of a great storm which
occurred in the summer of 1911, which overturned a tall chimney
stack and unroofed a portion of the buildings. No effort was
made by any prisoner to escape or in any way to take advantage
of the unfortunate circumstances, but the utmost good order
and propriety was observed by all of them.</p>

<h2 id="BORSTAL_ENGLAND">BORSTAL&mdash;ENGLAND.<br />

<span class="medium">(Extracts from letter of Daniel Buckley.)</span></h2>

<p class="author">
Paris, February 24th, 1912.<br />
</p>

<p>... I have visited several prisons in England, amongst
others, Pentonville, of which Secretary Votaw has already written
(in 1909) and Borstal, which I shall make the subject of
this letter.</p>

<p>... Borstal itself is in the country, in the county of Kent,
about three miles from, and between, the towns of Chatham and
Rochester, the former being reached by a forty-minute ride in
a fast train from London. It stands high on the hills overlooking
a beautiful valley, the shipping of Chatham and the Rochester
Cathedral. However, Borstal means much more than a local institution,
for it has given its name to a system of treatment
during and after confinement which has been so extraordinarily
successful that a modification of it is being practiced in nearly
all British prisons for both sexes. Unfortunately, I chose a Saturday
for my visit and as a sort of half-holiday is practiced there
my view of the different departments in operation was necessarily
hurried, and I cannot do better than give you, as much in his
own words as possible, the description given me by Thomas
Holmes a day or two before I made my visit.</p>

<p>In this place, since 1903, the Prison Commissioners have conducted
experiments with regard to young male prisoners from
which they have evolved the system to which the old prison has
given its name.</p>

<p>“In reality, it is an attempt by the State, to rescue young
persons from a life of crime and fit them for an honest industrial
life. It is unnecessary to point out the value of such work nor
to say that it is a new departure from the ordinary aims of penal
administration.</p>

<p>“Of course there were many difficulties in the way and the
Prison Commissioners found themselves hampered by lack of
funds; the State being chary in giving requisite support. But in
1908 the system, having proved abundantly successful, became
part and parcel of the penal system of the country and in 1909
prisons dealing only with the young offenders between the ages
of 16 and 21 became Borstal institutions.</p>

<p>“Now a word in explanation of the method of selecting the
inmates and their treatment. In 1908 the prevention of Crimes
Act was passed, several clauses of which dealt with the reformation
of young offenders. That they may be perfectly understood,
they are given in full:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>“Where a person is convicted on indictment for an offense for
which he is liable to be sent to penal servitude or imprisonment
and it appears to the Court, first, that the person is not less than
16 nor more than 21 years of age, and second, that by reason of
his criminal tendencies or habits, or association with persons of
bad character, it is expedient that he should be subject to detention
for such a term and under such instruction and discipline
as appears most conducive to his reformation and the repression
of crime, it should be lawful for the Court, in lieu of passing
a sentence of penal servitude, or imprisonment, to pass a sentence
of detention under penal discipline in the Borstal institution for
a term not less than one year and not more than three years;
and for the purpose of this act the Secretary of State may
establish Borstal Institutions, that is to say, places where young
offenders may be given, while under detention, industrial training
and instruction.</p>

<p>“This Act also gives power to the Prison Commissioners
to discharge on license, such offenders as they think fitted for
conditional liberty, but no license can be granted until the offender
has served at least six months of his sentence and every
offender whether he is released on license or has served his
complete sentence, remains after his discharge under the supervision
of the Prison Commissioners for several months.</p>

<p>“Another part of this Act provides that young offenders
sentenced to the Borstal treatment must be of good physical and
mental health and further provides that young men, up to the
age of 23 may now be admitted to Borstal institutions.”</p>

<p>Having explained the Genesis of the Borstal institution and
given you an idea of the class of young men who are admitted
to them, it will be well to give some details of the daily life
therein. The Borstalian, on his arrival is bathed and given his
uniform and the Warden who receives him reads him the rules
and gives him any necessary information. Next morning he sees
the Chaplain and is examined by the Doctor and finally brought
before the Governor. All his antecedents and capabilities are
inquired into; his education, knowledge, trades, his tastes, etc.,
are carefully tabulated and everything, little though it be, is
taken note of for the purposes of guiding the Authorities in directing
the young man’s future. Thus, if he has any knowledge
of a trade and wishes to continue it he is put straight at it; if
he has none, but appears a likely youth for a certain job, he
is put to that job at once.</p>

<p>“Should he be an ignorant and hopeless kind of youth for
whom training and discipline, smartness, etc. is necessary, he is
put among those who do the housecleaning, etc., where he must
work neatly, and be quick. Every Borstalian gets physical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
drill every morning for one-half hour and one hour’s gymnasium
three times a week when no fooling is allowed, for whether it be
physical drill or gymnastics, work or play, he must do his share,
perform all the exercises, every one of which has been carefully
planned for developing his physical and mental smartness.</p>

<p>“Education is not forgotten, for no sooner does he join the
institution than he begins to receive five hours tuition each week;
nor is he released from this until he can pass examinations which
prove him able to read with comparative ease, write intelligibly
and do simple figuring. Even then further education awaits him,
for special classes are formed on various subjects and lectures
on all topics are given in a large hall where he goes when his
behaviour and progress have been satisfactory. As magic lanterns
are frequently used to illustrate these lectures, you can
readily believe that these prove a great attraction.</p>

<p>“But the life at Borstal is not all work and no play for
the Prison Commissioners have recognized that if a youth must
work well it is essential that he play well, so recreation has not
been forgotten. After five months a youth of behaviour and
industry can obtain entrance to a special class and on three
evenings in the week may meet with others, to play, to read
and on Saturday afternoons may take part in football or cricket
as the season serves.</p>

<p>“It will be seen that work, education and play all have a
part in the life at Borstal but religion is not forgotten and I
know of no religious service more impressive than some of those
I have taken part in at this institution.</p>

<p>“Here is the programme of the daily life at the institution.
At 5:30 the prisoner arises and begins the day with a biscuit
and milk after which he cleans and tidies up his cell. At 7
o’clock he breakfasts on bread, porridge, margarine and with tea
and coffee, if he is in the special grade. At 7:30 he is in the
workshop or in the open; and carpentering, blacksmithing, bootmaking,
building, gardening, cooking, cleaning, or laundry work,
occupy him until noon, when dinner, consisting of bread, meat,
potatoes and pudding await him. After an hour and ten minutes
for dinner and rest he resumes work which continues until 5:30
when work ceases and there is a general parade reviewed by the
Governor after which he gets his last food for the day, generally
consisting of bread and cheese and a mug of cocoa.</p>

<p>“At 6:15 there is a general meeting in the Chapel when
short addresses are given by the Chaplain and others and encouraging
letters from discharged boys who are doing well are
read. Then they go to the evening classes after which there
is recreation for a few moments until 8:30 when they go to
their cells and shortly after lights are out.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>Surely this is a sensible day’s programme, a sensible system
and well applied. There are some faults in the plant but as
the system grew from a very small beginning and the buildings
were added from time to time this criticism is harsh. However,
different planning would greatly facilitate the training and decrease
the cost of maintenance. There are some in the system
which are in process of being remedied. For instance, it is
proposed to lengthen the period of licensed freedom to at least
one year so that each boy can prove himself without need of
care during the four seasons.</p>

<p>The care given these discharged Borstalians, either on license
or having served their full time, is most admirable. They are in
charge of the Borstal Association whose agents, aided by those
of over 60 County Societies for the aid of discharged prisoners,
have an eye, a very watchful eye, upon them and who report
frequently to the Association, and a glance at their records, absolutely
the most complete, concise and convenient imaginable,
one can be familiar with the whole history of any individual.
These records show, among multitudinous other things, that aid is
frequently required to establish a boy as a self-supporting, self-respecting
member of decent society. It is seldom more than
assistance in procuring work, or a heart-to-heart “big brother”
talk.</p>

<p>I wish every member of our committee could see these
records. Besides their primary function of recording they furnish
a wonderfully interesting human document, and a first-class
text-book on crime causes, the chances for reformation
of different characters, etc., etc., all based on the observation
of the individual, not when under restraint, but when, comparatively
speaking, a free agent.</p>

<p>Such records would have an incalculable value to us, if carefully
kept by the Authorities or Prison Associations of the different
States. In many places we are applying new systems, or old
systems to new conditions. New problems are almost bound to
arise, as the hordes of immigrants, reaching our shores daily,
have their effect on the national type, and without exact data as
to the cause of the failure of any system little can be done to better
it, and a better weapon to induce legislation, not to speak of
individual and corporate assistance in our work, would be hard to
imagine.</p>

<p>What is called the full Borstal system has not been practiced
long enough for some to consider it a proven success, but the
figures here given, those for prisoners released in 1909, give
cause for bright hopes at least.

<p>If 82 per cent. of our offenders were reformed our prisons
would be certainly a good investment, but it is only fair to remember
that not all convicted youths between 16 and 23, and no
adults of any sort, are brought under this treatment. Delicate
or defective physique of any sort makes it impossible. How to
make a cripple or a boy with a weak heart into a self-supporting
man within the limits of the short sentence such unfortunates
usually receive, is very hard to see. It is too short a time to learn
a trade and even the English authorities are ridiculously hampered
by laws preventing convict labor excepting upon articles
for State use, so that what is learned at prison is of little value
out of it....</p>

<p>The inspectors report the completion of a new building containing
120 cells, for which the last Legislature appropriated
$60,000.00. The actual cost was $52,698.11, and the balance of
the appropriation has been turned over to the Treasury of the
State. “In the erection of the building, no other than the labor
of the prisoners was employed.” They also state that the results
of the application of the Parole Law have been very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The assistance of the Pennsylvania Prison Society in providing
clothing for prisoners at the time of their discharge receives
grateful recognition.</p>

<h2 id="WESTERN_PENITENTIARY">WESTERN PENITENTIARY.</h2>

<p>The site for the Western Penitentiary of Pennsylvania has been
officially chosen by Warden John Francies and the Board of Prison Inspectors.
The selection of the site is subject to the approval of Gov.
John K. Tener, and is in Center County, a few miles from Bellefonte.
It contains 4,878 acres of fertile agricultural land, 936 acres being part
of a State forestry reservation, the rest, 3,942 acres, being held under
option from a number of private landowners. The cost of the private
land will be $191,655.</p>

<p>From the forest reservation ample wood for the construction of
preliminary buildings of the new prison may be drawn. The institution will
be entirely fireproof, and it is Warden Francies’ intention to have all the
manual labor entailed in its construction done by his wards.</p>

<p>From McBride’s Gap, which forms a cleft in Nittany Mountain, will
be drawn the new prison’s water supply. Warden Francies has obtained
the entire watershed of McBride’s Gap Run, giving the prison absolute
control of the sanitary condition of the drainage area. A beautiful roaring
spring of sparkling water descends from the Gap, which has a minimum
flow of 600,000 gallons of water per twenty-four hours. The water
in McBride’s Gap is of a high degree of purity. The sanitary condition
of the watershed, as found by engineers employed by Mr. Francies, is
excellent.</p>

<p>It is Warden Francies’ intention to construct a huge reservoir, which
will store about 70,000,000 gallons of water. Pressure will be at command
at all times to amply operate the mechanical and industrial departments
of the prison and meet the requirements of many homes which will be
built by the State for the officers of the new prison.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that each of the farms embraced by the Nittany
Mountain site is improved with farm houses in good state of repair, barns
and other outbuildings, that the properties are well fenced, drained, and
most of them have matured orchards, the average price per acre paid by
the State for the twenty-two farms is considered to be remarkably cheap.</p>

<p>In response to a request from the Society, we have received

<h2 id="PRISONERS_AID_SOCIETIES">PRISONERS’ AID SOCIETIES.</h2>

<p>Some few months ago, the Secretary of the <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania
Prison Society</span> sent to various Prisoners’ Aid Societies in the
United States a series of inquiries relative to the character of
the aid furnished by them to discharged prisoners.</p>

<p>A summary of these reports will prove interesting.</p>

<h3>MASSACHUSETTS SOCIETY FOR AIDING DISCHARGED CONVICTS.</h3>

<p>“This Society has furnished at one time or another to discharged
prisoners almost everything from clothing to artificial legs, eyes, teeth,
crutches, medicines, tools, jobs, transportation, board, etc.”</p>

<p>Their assistance is given not so much to those who are discharged
from the Penitentiary as to those who have served time in the County
Jails.</p>

<p>“Where a man is employed in some special occupation, he needs extra
clothing, such as waiter’s outfit, rubber boots for sea, overalls, etc., and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
where he is needy, change of underwear, socks, extra shirt, etc. We furnish
these articles. Last year, about $1800 was expended by me for clothing
out of a total expenditure of $9,479.10.”</p>

<h3>MAINE PRISON ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>This Association has been recently formed and so far its activities
have been directed to interesting the public and securing more effective
penal legislation.</p>

<p>There is a Prison Society at Portland, Maine, which gives help to
prisoners discharged from the County Jail. The clothing is solicited and
no money is paid except for expenses of lodging and transportation.</p>

<h3>PRISONERS’ AID ASSOCIATION, RHODE ISLAND.</h3>

<p>Their object is “to aid discharged prisoners in such ways and by
such means as will enable them to gain an honest and respectable livelihood,”
and also “to adopt such measures as shall seem to be conducive to
the prevention of crime.” For the present their efforts are chiefly directed
to the maintenance of a temporary Industrial Home for released women
prisoners. In 1910 their care extended to seventy women and eight children.</p>

<h3>PRISON ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK.</h3>

<p>This Association furnishes prisoners when discharged from the
County Prisons with clothing if they are in need. The applicant makes
personal request for help at their offices. The Association does not maintain
an Agent at the County Prison with purpose of determining what
clothing is necessary to be supplied. The Association solicits contributions
of clothing to be given to deserving ex-prisoners. They make a specialty
of caring for those who have been paroled and for those who have been on
probation. Their report last year shows an income of about $20,000, of
which $1,000 may have been used for clothing.</p>

<h3>THE WOMEN’S PRISON ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK CITY.</h3>

<p>This Society has an Agent whose sole business it is to keep in close
touch with all the women who have been arrested and taken to the sixty-eight
station houses in the city where women are admitted.</p>

<p>“The Isaac T. Hopper Home, under our care, is not a prison; those
admitted are expected to give a month’s service, at the end of which time
they are sent to service in private families; a few remain from choice,
and to some of these low wages are paid. During the month of trial,
they are not expected to go out. The atmosphere of the house is cheerful;
they have good beds and good food.”</p>

<h3>CONNECTICUT PRISON ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>The suit, shoes and hat are furnished by the prison authorities. This
Association furnishes under-clothing and overcoats to those discharged
from the State Prison. In 1909-1910, they expended for this purpose
$1,051. We believe this Association gets an appropriation from the State
amounting to $2500 per annum. They assist in the “Parole Work.”</p>

<h3>PRISON LEAGUE OF AMERICA.</h3>

<p>This organization, under the efficient control of Maud Ballington
Booth, in results attained, stands at the head of all Prisoners’ Aid Societies.
To all ex-prisoners who apply they give clothing, work and good
cheer. In Chicago they have at this time assumed sponsorship for nearly
300 prisoners.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>“The clothing part of it is only a small part of the much we do, but
it is often the very necessary part.”</p>

<p>In various parts of the country this Society maintains farms, at
which work is given to ex-prisoners, and where they are assisted in every
way on the road to reform.</p>

<h3>PRISON GATE MISSION, SALVATION ARMY, NEW YORK CITY.</h3>

<p>“Good substantial clothing is given us from time to time that generally
meets the needs of the people with whom we deal.”</p>

<p>They maintain industrial homes at which the opportunity is given
to labor for their best welfare. They are doing wonderful work, the
importance of which defies statistics. They are not directly connected
with the “Parole Work.”</p>

<h3>SOCIETY FOR THE FRIENDLESS.</h3>

<p>This organization appears to have headquarters in Kansas City,
Missouri, with branch associations in various states. The Gen. Supt. is
Rev. Edward A. Fredenhagen, Kansas City, Mo., to whom applications
for further information may be sent. As a rule, prisoners discharged
from city prisons, jails, lock-ups, etc., are not supplied with clothing, and
when they apply to the Society for the Friendless their wants are supplied
and an effort is made to furnish them with employment. The organization
endeavors to follow them up and to keep in touch with those whom they
have helped. They endeavor to co-operate with Parole Officers, but are
not officially connected with the work. Societies of the same name, mostly
branches of the organization at Kansas City, Mo., have made similar
responses from North Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, Iowa, Washington
and Minnesota.</p>

<p>Superintendent Parsons of the Minnesota Division says that last year
in pursuance of their work they “traveled 26,714 miles, delivered 265 addresses
to 42,870 people, made 176 jail visits, interviewed 1110 prisoners....
Places of employment have been found for 120, and a large
number more have found employment as the result of the care given
them.”</p>

<h3>NEBRASKA PRISON ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>The Legislature of this State appropriates $5,000 to supply the needs
of prisoners discharged from Penitentiary, and the work of administering
this charity appears to be undertaken by this Association.</p>

<h3>PRISON REFORM ASSOCIATION OF LOUISIANA.</h3>

<p>They furnish needy prisoners when discharged from county jails
with clothing. Up to this time they are not connected with “Parole Work.”</p>

<h3>PRISON ASSOCIATION OF GEORGIA.</h3>

<p>This organization has been organized but a few months, and has
not undertaken to distribute clothing to needy prisoners. They are endeavoring
to promote “Parole Work” and agree to employ any prisoner
who is entitled to “Parole.”</p>

<h3>PRISONERS’ AID ASSOCIATION OF MARYLAND.</h3>

<p>When prisoners come to them from the jails and appear to be in
need, they supply them with clothing. They are connected with the work
of paroling prisoners, and endeavor to follow them up by a system of
visitation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<h3>THE CENTRAL HOWARD ASSOCIATION; CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.</h3>

<p>“In reply to your first question, would say that in all of the eight
states in which this Association operates, the State itself furnishes a suit
of clothes, including an overcoat in winter, to all released prisoners except
in Kentucky, when men are paroled they do not receive clothing. In
addition a discharge fee of from $5 to $10 is given them to make a
new start. In one state, Minnesota, this discharge money amounts to
$25. Your second question is, therefore, answered by stating that this
Association is not called upon to furnish clothing and does not spend any
funds for that purpose. In the case of all those who come to us from
the Cook County Jail and the Chicago House of Correction, and do not
receive clothing or discharge money, we sometimes fit them out with better
clothing, but this is usually cast off clothing given to us by friends.”
* * * * “In answer to question five, would state that we are directly
connected with the ‘Parole Work’ in this and adjacent states. In the case
of those who are entitled to parole in Illinois and are without friends or
employers to sign their first papers, these papers are signed by me in many
cases, and I keep the men under supervision during the period of their
parole and they report through me to the officials. In the cases of adjoining
states, except where the law permits them to be paroled outside
of the state line, we secure employers who are residents of that state to
sign the parole papers and serve as ‘first friend’ to the prisoner. This
Association also furnishes a representative in connection with the Adult
Probation Law to work with the paid Probation Officers in the courts in
carrying out the provisions of said law.”</p>

<h3>COLORADO PRISON ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>They formerly furnished prisoners when discharged from the Penitentiary
with clothing, but after securing the passage of a law, whereby
the State provides such clothing, they no longer assume such expense. In
the “Parole Work” they endeavor to co-operate with the Wardens. Their
Field Secretary visits the jails throughout the State.</p>

<h3>HOME OF INDUSTRY, PHILADELPHIA.</h3>

<p>“Grand object&mdash;the founding and providing of a Retreat and Home
for Discharged Prisoners of the City of Philadelphia, and the State of
Pennsylvania, giving employment and compensation for labor performed,
and by moral and religious influences and surroundings to awaken in them
an incentive to true manliness and good citizenship....”</p>

<p>Last year 79 men were received in the Home who were supplied
with board and lodging, and for services received some wages. They
were assisted in securing situations for permanent employment. The State
recognizes their good efforts by making an appropriation of $2500.00 per
annum for maintenance.</p>

<h3>DOOR OF BLESSING, PHILADELPHIA.</h3>

<p>This Institution has been in existence about 11 years, and in that
time has taken charge of 357 women and 30 children. These women and
children come to them from either the State of City prisons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>Many of them are forwarded to their homes, and situations for others
are obtained in the country. Recently, through the Agent of The
Pennsylvania Prison Society, they receive many children who have been
arrested for vagrancy and petty offences, direct from the Magistrates, and
they receive kindly attention until they are restored to their friends or
have been placed in homes.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR VISITING CATHOLIC PRISONERS.</h3>

<p>The 16th Annual Report of the American Society for visiting Catholic
Prisons, just issued, shows that there were committed to the Eastern
Penitentiary of Pennsylvania in the year 1911, as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>

<p>The report states that “a committee of the society regularly visits
these unfortunates and seeks to convert the criminals into good citizens,”
and that during the past year 6256 visits were made.</p>

<p>Rev. M. A. Noel, S. J., is Catholic Chaplain of the Penitentiary,

<p>“One of the most excellent progressive movements of the period is
that which looks to a reform in the prison system and strives to convert
criminals into good citizens, useful to themselves, their families and society.
Governor Johnson has been a leader of the movement in California,
procuring the enactment of legislation greatly improving conditions in
the penitentiaries of the state. When the new system shall have been
operative for a reasonable period, men who have ‘done their time’ will
re-enter the world possessed of training that will enable them to maintain
themselves in honesty. Many a discharged criminal relapses into crime
because society has so ordered his punishment as to make reform practically
so difficult as to be almost impossible.</p>

<p>“Eleven per cent. of California’s convicts are under parole. Last
month but five of the 363 violated in any way the terms on which parole
was granted, and every one was at work. During the month they earned
$15,600.55, expended $11,721.08 and saved $3879.47. That is an excellent
record, but its excellence will be greatly increased under the new industrial
methods to be established for the benefit of the convicts in confinement.
They will be taught how to maintain themselves, and as those teachings
become effective and hope, courage and confidence are revived among men
who would be outcast derelicts were they released now, the percentage
released on parole will rise and the number of the redeemed increase.”

<h3>AN ACT.</h3>

<p class="hang">To define the rights and functions of official visitors of jails, penitentiaries,
and other penal or reformatory institutions, and providing for their
removal.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted, &amp;c., That any person designated by law to
be official visitor of any jail, penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory
institution, in this Commonwealth, maintained at the public expense, is
hereby authorized and empowered to enter and visit any such jail, penitentiary,
or other penal or reformatory institution, on any and every day,
including Sundays, between the hours of nine o’clock, ante meridian, and
five o’clock, post meridian; and not before nine o’clock, ante meridian,
or after five o’clock, post meridian, except with the special permission of
the warden, manager, overseer, or superintendent in charge of any such
jail, penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory institution.</p>

<p>Section 2. Upon any such visit of any official visitor to any such jail,
penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory institution, such visitor shall
have the right to interview privately any prisoner or inmate confined in
any such jail, penitentiary, or other penal reformatory institution, and
for that purpose to enter the cell, room, or apartment wherein any such
prisoner or inmate shall be confined: Provided, however, That if any
warden, manager, overseer, superintendent, or person in charge of such
institution at the time of such visit, shall be of the opinion that such entry
by the official visitor into the cell, room, or apartment of such prisoner
or inmate would be dangerous to the discipline of the institution, then and
in that case the said warden, superintendent, overseer, manager, or person
in charge, may conduct any prisoner or inmate, with whom such official
visitor may desire a private interview, into such other cell, room, or apartment
within the institution as he may designate and there permit the
private interview between the official visitor and such prisoner or inmate
to take place: Provided further, however, That no official visitor shall
have the right or power of privately interviewing any such prisoner or
inmate except prisoners or inmates of the same sex as such official visitor.</p>

<p>Section 3. All powers, functions, and privileges heretofore belonging
to official visitors of jails, penitentiaries, and penal or reformatory institutions,
under the common statute laws, are hereby confirmed: Provided,
however, That no such official visitor shall have the right or power to give
or deliver to any prisoner or inmate of any such jail, penitentiary, or penal
or reformatory institution, during such visit, any chattel or object whatsoever,
except objects and articles of religious or moral instruction or use.</p>

<p>Section 4. If any such official visitor shall violate any of the prohibitions
herein contained, any warden, manager, overseer, or superintendent
of any such jail, penitentiary, penal or reformatory institution, may apply
to any court of common pleas in the county wherein such institution may
be situated, for a rule upon such visitor to show cause why he or she
should not be deprived of his or her office; and upon proof to the satisfaction
of said court being made, such court shall enter a decree against
such official visitor, depriving him or her of all rights, privileges, and
functions of official visitor.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
