ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA PRISON
SOCIETY.

  1787        1912


The 125th Annual Meeting of “THE PENNSYLVANIA PRISON SOCIETY”
was held January 11th, 1912, at the office of the Society, S. W. Corner
Fifth and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, the President, JOSHUA L.
BAILY, in the Chair.

Twenty-eight members of the Society were present.

The Minutes of the 124th Annual Meeting were read and approved.

The Report of the Acting Committee was read by the Secretary.
The report was approved and was directed to be printed in the
“JOURNAL.” (See page 6)

The Treasurer, JOHN WAY, produced a detailed statement of the
receipts and disbursements for the fiscal year ending December 31,
1911. (See page 15)

GEORGE S. WETHERELL, on behalf of the Committee on
Nominations, presented a list of nominations for the officers of the
Society for the term of one year, beginning February 1, 1912, and for
the members of the Acting Committee whose terms expire at this time.
The President appointed JOS. C. NOBLIT and WILLIAM E.
TATUM as Tellers. The election being duly conducted, the Tellers
announced that a unanimous vote was cast for the ballot as proposed by
the Nominating Committee. (See page 3.)

On Motion HON. WILLIAM N. ASHMAN was elected Honorary
Counselor.

To nominate officers at the next Annual Meeting, the President
appointed JOSEPH C. NOBLIT, A. JACKSON WRIGHT,
ISAAC P. MILLER, MRS. MARY S. GRIGG and MRS. EMMA
L. THOMPSON.

The following Amendment to Article VII of the Constitution, proposed
at the last Annual Meeting, was read, and after some discussion,
unanimously adopted.

“The number of Members of the Acting Committee may be increased to not
exceeding sixty, provided the additional Members shall be residents of
Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia.

“These Members may be elected from time to time at any meeting of
the Acting Committee, according to the provisions of the By-Laws for
filling vacancies, but the terms for which they are elected shall
be for the unexpired portion of the current fiscal year only. These
additional Members will be eligible for re-election at the next Annual
Meeting, and their respective terms of service shall then be assigned
so as to be co-ordinate with the terms of service of the other Members
of the Committee.”

The President spoke in acknowledgment of the honor of his re-election
to the Presidency of this Society, the oldest organization of the kind
in the world. He congratulated the Society on the increased interest as
manifested by the attendance at this meeting and by the larger amount
of contributions received in 1911 for the work of the Society.

  ALBERT H. VOTAW, _Secretary_.




REPORT OF THE ACTING COMMITTEE FOR THE YEAR 1911.


In the year 1912, the PENNSYLVANIA PRISON SOCIETY will have
completed a century and a quarter of its existence. It seems opportune
briefly to note some of the important features of the work of this
organization during the last 125 years. We are fortunate in the
possession of an unbroken series of records of the transactions of this
body from its first meeting in May, 1787, to the present time.

In 1787 the conditions of the jails in Philadelphia were unspeakably
disgraceful. In one common herd there were kept by day and by night
prisoners of all ages, colors, degrees of crime, and the sexes were
not separated. No bedding was supplied and unless the prisoner had
means or friends, he slept on the ground or bare floor. One loaf of
bread constituted the daily ration. Misconduct was punished by the
branding-iron, the pillory, or by the lash. Intoxicants were sold to
all applicants who had money. The keeper reaped a profit from all sales
made to the inmates of the prison. The death rate was enormous. No
effort was made to find any useful employment for the prisoners.

The Society early resolved that intoxicants must be forbidden and that
some form of employment must be found. They insisted on segregation
of the sexes, and also began to press for individual separation in
order that the penal institutions should not become schools for crime.
Within a very few years many reforms were instituted. The death penalty
which had been inflicted for a score of crimes was abrogated except
for murder in the first degree. “Solitary confinement to hard labor”
is still a familiar phrase used by Judges in pronouncing sentence. In
its early years, the Society consistently and persistently urged the
adoption of a system of employment whereby each prisoner alone in his
cell should perform his task in some industrial pursuit. It was never
intended that the prisoners should be kept entirely secluded from all
human companionship, but that the officers should see them frequently
and that concerned visitors, under proper supervision, should be
allowed to talk with them and endeavor to point them to the better
way. This idea became known among penologists as “The Pennsylvania
System,” and was discussed widely, both at home and abroad. The Eastern
Penitentiary, on Fairmount Avenue, formerly Coates Street, was built
upon plans largely suggested by this Society. Doubtless the separate
system was entirely carried out in 1829, when the prison was opened for
the reception of prisoners. But in the last half century, the number
of prisoners has exceeded the number of cells, so that the officers of
the prison have not been able to carry out this system as originally
planned. When this penitentiary was first constructed, it was located
on what was then known as Cherry Hill, an eminence in the Northwest
suburban district, and was surrounded by farming land. That penal
institutions should be located in the country is, therefore, not a new
proposition. Now it is generally conceded that such institutions not
only should be located in the country, but that they should own and
work a large tract of land adjacent.

    The first prisoner was received Oct. 25, 1829. The first report
    of the Committee to visit the Eastern Penitentiary was made to
    the Acting Committee on Nov. 11, 1829, and shows that there were
    two prisoners at that time in the institution, one a white man
    from Chester Co., the other a colored man from Delaware Co. By
    June 8, 1830, the number of prisoners had increased to 25. The
    following extracts from the report of the Visiting Committee, made
    in June, 1830, will prove interesting to those who are familiar
    with the present conditions at the Penitentiary. “* * * The best
    order prevails among the prisoners who are industriously, and
    it is believed, profitably employed. Each is supplied with a
    soup-pan, washbasin, brush, fine and coarse tooth comb, spoon,
    knife and fork, and every week with a clean towel. Each prisoner is
    required to keep his room clean and neat. * * * The food consists
    of half a pint of milk, mixed in the same amount of hot water,
    bread made of rye and Indian meal (one pound) for breakfast; for
    dinner one pint soup, three-fourths pound meat, one-third pound
    bread; for supper one pint Indian mush and a half gill molasses.
    * * * No conversation can take place between the prisoners, and
    no communication from without be permitted. It has not been found
    necessary to inflict any punishment so far, except in two cases:
    in one case where a prisoner had neglected to keep his mess-pan
    clean, he lost two meals; in another case, a prisoner who neglected
    his work was for three days deprived of his meat. The principal
    trades are weaving and shoemaking, trades which may be carried on
    in cells to advantage. The health of the prisoners continues good.”
    The report is signed June 8, 1830, by the entire Visiting Committee
    consisting of David Weatherly and James J. Barclay. Now after 80
    years the supply of furniture is practically the same, a table or
    stand being added. Sanitary arrangements have been vastly improved,
    and the addition of a superior grade of homemade wheat bread and
    coffee to the bill of fare has made a more palatable menu.

Some forty years ago it was written that every advance in the
amelioration of convict prisons systems of discipline began in
Philadelphia. In the discussion of these problems THE PENNSYLVANIA
PRISON SOCIETY took a conspicuous part. In 1856 the first
published criticism of the contract system, under which the labor of
the prisoners was sold for profit and to meet the prison expenses,
issued from Philadelphia. The criticism was received with scorn
and ridicule. Thoughtful students of humanitarian measures began
investigations in one State after another, with the result that at the
present time scarcely one State in the Union maintains such a system.
But while Pennsylvania has led the way in many measures to reform the
criminal and improve his condition, some States have made more rapid
progress in these directions. Many States offer greater opportunities
in their prisons for industrial employment than we can show in
Pennsylvania. Most of the States have preceded us in the adoption of a
Parole and a Probation system for adult convicts.


PROBATION, PAROLE, INDETERMINATE SENTENCE.

In 1909, the Legislature of Pennsylvania enacted a law providing for
Probation for some classes of adult offenders, and also for a Parole
of criminals sentenced to the Penitentiaries of the State under the
conditions of an Indeterminate Sentence. Under the Probation Act, the
Courts have power to suspend the imposition of the sentence and to
place the defendant on Probation on such terms and conditions as the
Court may deem proper.

The Parole Law applied to the sentences of criminals sentenced to
the Penitentiary on and after June 30, 1909. Two Members of THE
PENNSYLVANIA PRISON SOCIETY were very active in framing this law
and in securing its passage. The Legislature of 1911 amended this law
so as to render almost nugatory some of the provisions of the law with
regard to the Indeterminate Sentence. The Chairman of our Committee on
Legislation has ably discussed this subject in an article published in
the JOURNAL which was issued in November, 1911. The following
statistics, furnished by Parole Officer, JOHN MCKENTY, of the
Eastern Penitentiary, show the operation of the law to the end of the
year 1911.

  Number paroled since the law was effective                 128
  Number returned for failure to fulfill requirement          15
  Number not reporting                                         3
  Number of those paroled who have received final discharge   10
  Number on Parole December 31, 1911                         100
  Percentage of success                                     85.9%

These figures compare quite favorably with the results reported from
other States in which this system has been for a longer period in vogue.


THE EASTERN PENITENTIARY.

Reports of the Members of the Acting Committee, appointed to visit the
Eastern Penitentiary, show that during the year 1911 6405 visits to
prisoners have been made. Many unreported visits have gladdened the
prisoner in his lonely cell. Several of our members participate in the
Gospel services on the Sabbath.

One of the prisoners remarked to the Secretary that in his opinion the
work of visitation was the most important function of the Society.
This has been the most effective part of our work from the first. Some
of the men’s blocks are not visited so often as would be desirable.
The women’s block is said to be over-visited. Several organizations
have the privilege of sending visitors to the twenty-seven women now
incarcerated, and while visitors are welcomed at suitable times and
under proper conditions, yet it is readily recognized that these
prisoners of the women’s block should have sufficient time to attend to
their regular, but not onerous, duties as assistants in various lines
of domestic employment.

Under the management of Warden ROBERT J. MCKENTY, the
administration is to be commended. The discipline is firm, but kindly,
and so long as the privileges granted are not abused, there is allowed
a large amount of freedom within reasonable limits. Hence, in this
institution, the visitor may note an unusually contented and orderly
body of convicts.


RELIEF FOR PRISONERS WHEN DISCHARGED.

The expense of supplying needy prisoners with clothing at the time of
their discharge from the Eastern Penitentiary has been almost entirely
borne by this Society since 1896. For the six years prior to 1896,
the Legislature appropriated on the average of $2490.00 annually to
the Society, which thereupon assumed the expense of providing outfits
for the prisoners at the time of their release. In 1895, the Governor
refused to sanction the appropriation. No legislative grant of funds
has been made since that time to the Society. Our late Honorary
Secretary, JOHN J. LYTLE, who at that time was the General
Secretary of the Society, with untiring energy solicited contributions
from benevolent citizens to supply the prisoners when released with
presentable clothing. His whole heart was in this work and nobly did he
discharge what he deemed to be his duty to administer the charity in
which our Society had been, up to that time, assisted by the State. We
are still providing an outfit for discharged prisoners, although this
aid is supplied by legislative appropriation practically in every other
State of the Union. I append to this report a schedule showing what
provision is made for prisoners at the time of their discharge from the
various State Prisons. (See page 38.)

During the year, 1911, the Secretary has furnished 370 men at the time
of their discharge from the Eastern Penitentiary either with entire
outfits, or with sufficient attire to make them presentable.

The following list shows what garments have been given:

  Coats                            293
  Vests                            294
  Pants                            294
  Dress Shirts                     243
  Underclothing (pieces)           474
  Hats                             332
  Suspenders, pairs                326
  Neck-ties                        314
  Collars                           41
    Total number of garments      2611

A few of the women on their discharge have been furnished with suitable
articles of apparel.

The administration of this charity is attended with peculiar
advantages. It is an important duty to visit the prisoners near the
close of their time of incarceration, and to learn from them with
regard to their hopes and fears. Then, if ever, they need sympathetic
attention. Many of them have friends or homes ready to receive them,
but there are others who need more than a suit of clothes and a parting
word of good wishes. We endeavor to find employment for such as these
unfortunate ones, and, while in many cases we have succeeded, there
is a remnant who are not strong enough to face the temptations of the
outer world. Shall we not send such as these to a farm under control of
the State, where they will have opportunity to work in the open air,
and be retained in some kind of semi-detention until they have made
good?


WESTERN PENITENTIARY.

Two members of the Acting Committee, who reside in Pittsburg, have
reported various visits and some Gospel service in the Western
Penitentiary.

In response to an inquiry with regard to the provision made for the
prisoners of that institution at the time of their discharge, Warden
JOHN FRANCIES writes as follows:

  A. H. VOTAW, Secretary,
  The Pennsylvania Prison Society,
  Philadelphia, Pa.

  DEAR SIR:--

Replying to your inquiry of Dec. 20, 1911, permit me to reply as
follows:--

1. With regard to money to prisoners on discharge.

This depends upon the distance the prisoner is going. If within a
radius of fifty miles, $5.00 is given. If outside the radius of fifty
miles, $10.00 is given.

2. With regard to clothing to prisoners on discharge.

The prisoner is given $10.00 worth of clothing as provided for in
appropriation by last session of Legislature.

3. Clothing supplied.

Suit complete, and furnishings, viz.: hat, shirt, shoes, hose, tie,
collar, etc.

  Yours very truly,
  JOHN FRANCIES, _Warden_.

At the last session of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, authority was
granted to remove this prison from Allegheny City to some large tract
of land amid healthier surroundings, and we have learned that a site
has been selected about eight miles from Bellefonte in Centre county.
Full opportunity will be afforded here to test the out-door treatment.

Chaplain MILLER, of the Western Penitentiary, has kindly
furnished the following statistics with regard to those paroled from
that institution:

  Whole number paroled                                         100
  Number returned                                               15
  Number not reporting                                           0
  Number of those paroled who have received final discharge      1
  Number deceased                                                2
  Number now on parole                                          82
  Percentage of success                                         85%


PHILADELPHIA COUNTY PRISONS.

The Committee appointed to visit the Philadelphia County Prisons have
been diligent in this service and the reports show that 6100 visits
have been made to the prisoners at Moyamensing and Holmesburg.

The General Agent, FRED. J. POOLEY, has assisted several
hundred at the time of their discharge with lodging, clothing, railroad
fares, and with articles to sell, while they are awaiting more
permanent employment. He has given help to a considerable number in
securing situations. The Door of Blessing has indeed proved to be true
to its name in giving help to the women at the time of their discharge.


GENERAL AGENT.

Our General Agent, FRED. J. POOLEY, has found a large field
for service at the Central Police Station at City Hall. He makes a
special object to have interviews with those who have had a preliminary
hearing before Magistrates, and who have been committed for trial
before the Judges at City Hall. More than a thousand letters has he
written in behalf of those who have been arrested in the last year.
Very often he secures the release of young prisoners by promptly
communicating with parents or relatives, who assume responsibility
for the offender. Thus many first offenders are turned from the error
of their ways by this timely attention, and escape the schooling in
crime which they would inevitably receive by further association with
hardened criminals. The work requires to be done with the utmost tact
and discretion, and several of the Magistrates have borne testimony
to the efficient service of our General Agent. He has presented a
more detailed report, an abstract of which will be printed in the
“JOURNAL.”


COUNTY PRISONS (OUTSIDE OF PHILADELPHIA.)

Members of our Acting Committee have reported visits to the prisons
in Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Monroe, Lancaster
and Westmoreland and other counties. With the passage of the proposed
amendment to our Constitution, providing for additions to the Acting
Committee, it will be possible to secure workers in other counties of
the State, who, we trust, will be of material assistance in collecting
information, and also in co-operating with us to secure measures to
ameliorate some of the evils of the present system. There are very
few county jails in the State whose construction and management may
be regarded as creditable. Some of the officials are doubtless doing
the best they can with the means at hand. But the great majority of
jails throughout the State have made little progress in the last half
century. “No prison without employment” should be our campaign cry.
It ought not to be impracticable for a number of the smaller counties
to unite in the management of a prison farm to which petty offenders
should be sent. Such a farm should be self-supporting.

It should not be forgotten that the State of Pennsylvania has at least
two institutions which for some years have illustrated the value and
efficacy of farm life for prisoners. One is the Huntingdon Reformatory,
the other is the Allegheny Work House at Hoboken.


AMERICAN PRISON CONGRESS.

Since our JOURNAL for 1911 was issued so late in that year,
it gave opportunity to include in its contents an account of the
Proceedings of the American Prison Association, which met in Omaha,
Nebraska, in October, 1911. This report was prepared by the secretary
of the Society, who was appointed Delegate to the Association.
DEBORAH C. LEEDS was also present at the sessions of this
body. In 1912, the Association will be held in Baltimore, Maryland, and
we hope a considerable number of the members of our Society will attend
its sessions.


ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

By motion of the Acting Committee passed in June, 1911, DR. WILLIAM
C. STOKES was appointed Assistant to the Secretary. His duties
have been to assist in the clerical work of the office, and especially
to endeavor to increase the amount of funds collected for the use of
the Society. Since his appointment, the office has been kept open
during the greater part of the business hours of each day, and we have
felt there was an important service in having the office accessible
at all time to members and visitors. Since June 21st, a Register for
Visitors has been kept, and the record shows that 417 visitors had
registered to December 31st from 35 States. A few foreign visitors were
received. Many of these visitors appear to appreciate information about
the work in which we are engaged, and they generally accept some of our
publications. We believe this opportunity to present some features of
our work will prove of some value.


OBITUARIES.

During the year 1911, the Acting Committee lost by death three of its
members.

On Eighth Month 18, our beloved Honorary Secretary, John J. Lytle,
passed away from his residence at Moorestown, N. J.

On Second Month, 15, Miss Mary S. Whelen, formerly a very active and
efficient member of the Active Committee, died at her home in this city.

On Seventh Month 1, Robert P. Nicholson, a new, but deeply interested,
member died, as the result of an accident.

Appropriate notices of these valued members appeared in our
JOURNAL of October, 1911.


THE SCOPE OF OUR WORK.

In 1787, the labors of the Founders of our organization were confined
to the prisons of Philadelphia. It was but a few years when they found
it necessary, in order to accomplish certain reformatory measures, to
petition the Legislature for some changes in, or additions to, the
penal code. As time passed their interest extended beyond the limits
of Philadelphia, but it was almost a hundred years after the founding
of the Society that its name was changed from “The Philadelphia
Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons” to “THE
PENNSYLVANIA PRISON SOCIETY.” Our interests are State-wide,
and in furtherance of this, the Membership of the Acting Committee
has recently been increased by the election of other interested
citizens residing in counties outside of Philadelphia, thus enlarging
the sphere of our influence. For many years, the Society has had
the valuable services on its Acting Committee of two members from
Pittsburg and several from counties adjacent
to Philadelphia, but closer relations with the prison work in all parts
of the State are much to be desired.

Our Master said, “I was in prison and ye came unto me.” In the spirit
of the Master, let us endeavor to impress in the name of humanity,
all well-disposed people everywhere to lend a helping hand to their
brothers and sisters who have been overtaken by a fault.

  On behalf of the Acting Committee,
  ALBERT H. VOTAW, _Secretary_.




DEATH OF ROBERT B. ADAMS.


Robert B. Adams, a former member of the Acting Committee of the
Pennsylvania Prison Society, who resigned in the autumn of 1911, on
his removal from the city to accept the Secretaryship of the Y. M. C.
A. at Rochester, N. Y., died Jan. 18, 1912, after a short illness from
pneumonia. He was a genial man of broad sympathies, and his loss will
be felt by a large circle of friends and by a host of unfortunates by
whose ministrations they had received help and inspiration.

GENERAL AGENT’S REPORT 1911.


  To the Acting Committee of The Pennsylvania Prison Society:

With the close of another year, your General Agent takes pleasure in
making the following report:

Regular visits have been made to the Eastern Penitentiary and all the
prisoners received at the institution during the year were visited, and
with the consent of the officials I have written letters to relatives
of many of the prisoners, some of whom had not written home for years.

Regular visits have been made to Moyamensing Prison and to Philadelphia
County Prison at Holmesburg. Over 6,000 prisoners have been visited
and more than 600 assisted with room rent, board and lodging, railroad
tickets, tools, car-fare and employment, etc.

Your General Agent has made daily visits to the Central Police Courts
and to the cells at City Hall. During the year, 1911, 1,238 letters
were written by him to relatives and friends of those under arrest,
by whose assistance or advice, bail was secured in many cases, and in
other cases a discharge was obtained. During the month of December, 181
letters were written at City Hall, as follows:

  Letters sent to prisoner’s mother           44
     “     “   “      “      father           17
     “     “   “      “      sister           32
     “     “   “      “      brother          24
     “     “   “      “      wife             26
     “     “   “      “      aunt              8
     “     “   “      “      uncle             2
     “     “   “      “      husband           2
     “     “   “      “      friend           26
                                             ---
     “    written during December, 1911      181

I will mention a few of the cases to show the importance of the work of
the Agent at City Hall.

No. 1.--A young man from Martinsburg, W. Va., arrested for being on the
streets without a home; the Magistrate held him for ten days to give me
an opportunity to look into the case. I learned that he had been from
home eighteen months. I wrote to his family and obtained his discharge.
He wrote on his arrival home:--

  “My dear friend Mr. Pooley:--

    “I arrived home safe last evening at 6.30 P. M., and was met by my
    father at the station. My father, mother and sister welcomed me at
    home and even my little dog also. I just arrived in time, thanks to
    you, for my folks were about to move to Mexico City, Mexico.

  “Thanking you for your great kindness to me,
  “Very truly yours,”

No. 2.--A young man from New York left home without consent of his
relatives--found himself stranded in Philadelphia--was arrested and
given ten days in County Prison. I wrote to his mother, who came on to
this city and obtained his discharge.

No. 3.--Case of a woman arrested for spending her evenings in Broad
Street Station. I questioned her closely and found that because of an
unkind word with her sister, she left home and spent her evenings in
the Station, not having anywhere else to go. She told me who she was
and where her sister lived; I visited the sister, who was delighted to
know her sister was found. We obtained her discharge and she went home.

No. 4.--Two young men charged with larceny from a department store. At
the request of the Magistrate, I investigated the case and found the
young men were from New York City; at once a letter was sent to their
people; father came on; the charge was withdrawn; the boys discharged
and their father took them home.

No. 5.--A young man from Louisiana arrested for stealing; said he had
nothing to eat for three days; was committed for court; said he would
not disgrace his family as his father had a nice business in the South,
but he would not tell his address. During his conversation, he told
me his father came to Philadelphia twice a year to buy goods, and
mentioned one of the places where he bought them. I went to the place
he mentioned and found his father was then in the city; I left a note
asking him to meet me. He did so, and was deeply touched to learn where
his son was. He at once went to the prison and took an attorney with
him, and when the case came to court his son was discharged, and he
went home with his father.

No. 6.--A young man from Massachusetts charged with robbing, who told
me he had not written home for six years. I wrote to his father, who
was delighted to know that the lost son had been found. When the case
came to court, the young man was discharged and he went home with his
father.

The cases mentioned are only a few of the many, but they indicate
the character and importance of the work of the General Agent at The
Central Police Station.

While visiting the cells in the Central Station, City Hall, I always
feel a great responsibility resting upon me. I feel that a word spoken
in kindness and love may awaken thoughts of the days of innocence and
inspire them to endeavor to regain what they had lost.

The officials of the City Hall have been very helpful to me in doing
all they can to help along the work. I deeply appreciate their kindly
services.

“Sabbath Reading” has been distributed weekly through the personal
efforts of our late friend, John J. Lytle. The subscriptions to this
useful and appreciated magazine will expire in March, 1912, per annum.
Something over $100 is needed to renew the subscription and I trust
that way may open for the continuance of this benefaction.

Thanks are due to many of our friends for magazines and papers for the
prisoners.

During the past year Emlen Hutchinson, Esq., Chairman of Board of
Inspectors, Philadelphia Prison, has kindly sent me $80.00 for the
purpose of sending home runaway boys, a donation of great usefulness.

  Respectfully submitted,
  FREDERICK J. POOLEY, _General Agent_.

    ENFORCE IDLENESS OF PRISONERS


    The law of Pennsylvania limits to thirty-five per cent. of the
    whole number of convicts, those who may be employed in any of the
    trades; as a consequence, the greater number of them are consigned
    to enforced idleness. No punishment could be more severe, and if
    punishment is the chief object of our penal system, it is certainly
    secured by Pennsylvania law. It is a system, however, which belongs
    to an age long since past, when the reformation of the criminal had
    little or no consideration.

    It is proper that an evil-doer should suffer punishment and that
    society should be protected from his evil ways, but humanity and
    Christianity alike require that at the same time that he is subject
    to the restraints of the law, the wisest efforts should be made
    for his improvement and reformation, the correction of his evil
    propensities, and the formation of good habits, to the intent that
    when the prison gates are opened to him he may have a fair chance
    to become an upright and useful citizen.

    This end cannot be attained by keeping the convict in idleness,
    the most fruitful source of immorality and mental and physical
    degeneracy. This law of enforced idleness is not only cruel and
    inhuman, as to the convict, it is improvident as to the State, for
    the convict, if employed, could not only earn a large part, if not
    the entire cost of his maintenance, and thus relieve the community
    of this burden, but he would be able to lift another and greater
    burden which must rest somewhere, the support of his family during
    his imprisonment.

    Under the present system the guilty convict is not the chief
    sufferer. The severity of the punishment falls heaviest upon his
    family--the innocent wife and children.


    UNWISE AND VICIOUS.

    Is it not surprising that legislators who are responsible for this
    compulsory idleness do not see its unwisdom and viciousness?

    Instead of permitting the convict to earn his maintenance by his
    own labor, a fellow-laborer outside the prison walls is taxed
    to support him in idleness, an idleness which only intensifies
    whatever criminal propensities he possesses, instead of curing
    them, and increases his capacity for depredations upon society when
    the prison doors are open to him.

    In other words, for every man within prison walls who does not
    earn his maintenance, some man outside has to earn it for him. The
    Divine decree, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread,”
    is reversed in the case of the man who eats his bread in the sweat
    of some other man’s face.

  JOSHUA L. BAILY.




    THE PHILADELPHIA COUNTY PRISON AT HOLMESBURG.


    The Philadelphia County Prison, located at Holmesburg, between the
    Philadelphia and New York Railroad and Torresdale Avenue, about
    6 miles north of the City Hall, and known as the new jail, was
    erected some 15 years ago. It occupies a plot of land containing
    about 21 acres. The wall which encloses the buildings sets back
    from the outer line of the property about 30 feet, so that the
    acreage of the interior is about 18 acres. The stone walls are
    35 feet in height above ground and 12 feet under the surface, so
    that the entire height of the masonry is 47 feet. The wall is 6
    feet wide at the top and about twice that width at the base, and
    entirely enclosing four sides of the tract. The cost of this wall,
    including labor and materials, was $835,000.

    In the center of the building is a rotunda 80 feet in width and
    about 70 feet in height, surmounted by a lantern. From this center
    six one-story corridors, or blocks, radiate like the spokes of a
    wheel. These vary somewhat in length, but average about 330 feet,
    and there is an average of about 70 cells in each. The floor space
    of each cell is 8×18 feet and the ceiling height is 13 feet,
    surmounted by a skylight. Of these corridors, A, B, C, and D are
    occupied by white prisoners, and two of the corridors, E and F, by
    colored. The number of prisoners at this date, February 1st, 1912,
    is 715, about ninety less than at this time last year. About 60 per
    cent. are white and 40 per cent. colored. All the prisoners are
    men. All women convicts are sent to the Moyamensing Prison.

    The total number of cells is 440, and usually each cell is occupied
    by two prisoners. Every cell is provided with a wash basin with
    running water, a closet, two iron bedsteads, a table and one or two
    stools. Each bedstead is provided with a mattress stuffed with 25
    pounds of hand-picked corn husks and a 7-pound pillow of the same
    material. Beside a pair of sheets and pillow cases each prisoner
    has two 4-pound blankets of excellent quality.

    When a prisoner enters he undergoes a careful examination and a
    very complete record is made of all his personal characteristics.
    He then goes to the bathing room. An entirely new suit of clothing
    is given him, and the clothing with which he entered the prison
    is tied up in a sack, to which his name is attached by a tag. The
    sack is then placed in a room provided for that purpose, where it
    remains until his discharge from the jail.

    Wednesday and Thursday are bathing days, and each prisoner is
    required to take a bath at least once a week unless the physician
    certifies that the condition of the prisoner’s health would
    render bathing inexpedient. A change of bedding and underclothing
    is supplied to each prisoner on every Saturday.

    [Illustration: OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATION, PHILADELPHIA COUNTY
    PRISON FOR CONVICTS, AT HOLMESBURG]

    About 200 of the prisoners are employed in various trades, in
    carpentering 7, on tin work 2, making mattresses 2, as tailors
    14, shoemakers 20, making brushes 10. These all occupy separate
    apartments. In one additional apartment there are 15 hand looms, on
    which are made the muslin used for sheets, etc. About 18 men are
    employed in connection with this weaving. There are in the same
    apartment 24 stocking weaving machines, employing one man each.
    About 20 find employment in the laundry, and beside these there are
    about 70 men employed in various duties, to wit: 14 men in cooking,
    14 in the bake house, 6 in the boiler room, etc. The men employed
    in these various engagements have their meals in a dining room
    apart from the other prisoners, a room having 6 tables, seating 12
    each.

    The kitchen for this great establishment is a very spacious one and
    very complete and convenient in all its appointments. There are 6
    large steam heated copper boilers intended for making soups. In
    these boilers 250 gallons of soup are made per day during 4 days of
    the week and an equal quantity of what is known as Irish stew on
    the other 3 days. The basis of the soup and stew is fresh beef or
    mutton.

    From 700 to 800 pounds of fresh meat is furnished to the jail every
    day and is hung in a cold storage room, ready for use as wanted.
    There is in addition another storage room in which are stored a
    great quantity of canned tomatoes, barrels of rice, barley, etc.,
    etc.

    The bakery is also very spacious with 4 arched ovens and 4 kneading
    troughs. Eight barrels of flour are converted into bread every day,
    excepting on Sunday, a double quantity being baked on Saturday. The
    number of loaves baked averages about 900 daily, the weight of each
    being 2 pounds, this being a proportion of something more than one
    loaf a day to each prisoner, and it is worth while to add that the
    bread is uniformly baked and of unimpeachable quality.

    Still another large room is used for the production of chocolate
    and what is called coffee. It is necessary to state that no coffee
    is used, but the article which passes by that name is rye, which is
    roasted and ground and boiled in copper boilers; 25 pounds of this
    material is used every morning and suffices to furnish about 3 half
    pints to each prisoner.

    An equal quantity of chocolate is furnished for the supper. A
    dessert of prunes is furnished each prisoner on every Friday.

    The boiler room, some 30×80 feet in dimensions, requires the
    attention of 6 men, and from this room an extensive system of steam
    piping permeates every portion of the buildings and furnishes the
    power for the engine and for the electric lighting. Electric lights
    are throughout all the premises, including each cell.

    An ample supply of filtered water is furnished by the Holmesburg
    and Tacony Water Co., for which the jail pays $2,000 per annum.

    The city had under consideration a proposal to purchase this water
    company, but the price at which it was valued, $146,000, seemed to
    the authorities too high.

    There are in the prison at this date 9 cases of tuberculosis. These
    occupy cells entirely apart from the other prisoners, cells which
    open out on one side to the open air. The patients have liberty
    within and without, as their own pleasure and convenience suggests,
    and when the weather is suitable most of their time is spent in
    walking or lounging in the prison yard. Besides this, there are but
    few cases of sickness in the prison at this time.

    Up to within a recent period, the prisoners all wore striped
    clothing, but on June 1st of last year this mark of distinction
    was abolished and the prisoners were all given new suits free from
    any distinctive mark. The striped clothing is now worn only as a
    punishment for misdemeanor and for which purpose there has been
    so far only little occasion. The exhibition of a suit of striped
    clothing to a prisoner or the mere mention of a possibility of his
    being compelled to wear one, has been found sufficient in most
    cases to subdue and bring the most obdurate prisoners to terms.

    There is a library of about 5,000 volumes. Each prisoner being
    furnished with a catalogue is permitted to select as many as 2 or 3
    books a week, the keepers often kindly assisting in making suitable
    selections. Two or three men are constantly employed in the care of
    the library and in rebinding the books, which become much soiled or
    in need of rebinding.

    There are religious services in each corridor on Sunday afternoon,
    and at the close of that service the choir of colored men,
    numbering about 20, give sacred singing from the center of the
    rotunda, much to the enjoyment of the prisoners, all of whom can
    hear distinctly, even from the farthest extremity of the corridors.

    A very interesting and commendable condition of the Holmesburg
    Jail is that the use of tobacco is prohibited. This prohibition
    includes the use of chewing or smoking tobacco or cigars, and
    extends not to the prisoners only, but to all the keepers. It is
    said that although this is a hard experience to a large majority of
    the prisoners on entering, they soon adapt themselves to it, and
    from the standpoint of health are undoubtedly better off for this
    abstinence.

    The entire cost of the maintenance of this jail after deducting
    about $5000 each year for sales of manufactured articles or of
    waste materials, is a little less than $100,000, which money is
    appropriated by City Councils.

    If the chief aim in the erection of this prison was to secure a
    place of confinement from which there would be but the remotest
    possibility of escape, the end has certainly been attained, but no
    one could go through the buildings and observe their harmonious and
    intelligent adaptation to all requirements without the conviction
    that the health and physical comfort of the prisoners had been
    made the chief consideration. The visitor, however, will have much
    occasion for dissatisfaction on finding that the majority of the
    convicts are _without employment_, but this is no fault of the
    Inspectors, who are charged with the administration of the affairs
    of the prison; the law of the State is at fault in that it limits
    to 35 per cent. of the whole number of convicts those who may be
    employed in any of the trades, and, as a consequence, the greater
    number of men are compelled to remain idle.

    Notwithstanding this very much to be regretted condition, too much
    cannot be said of the good order and effective discipline which
    prevails at the Holmesburg Prison. A striking example of that was
    had at the time of a great storm which occurred in the summer of
    1911, which overturned a tall chimney stack and unroofed a portion
    of the buildings. No effort was made by any prisoner to escape or
    in any way to take advantage of the unfortunate circumstances, but
    the utmost good order and propriety was observed by all of them.

    BORSTAL--ENGLAND.

    (Extracts from letter of Daniel Buckley.)


  Paris, February 24th, 1912.

    ... I have visited several prisons in England, amongst others,
    Pentonville, of which Secretary Votaw has already written (in 1909)
    and Borstal, which I shall make the subject of this letter.

    ... Borstal itself is in the country, in the county of Kent, about
    three miles from, and between, the towns of Chatham and Rochester,
    the former being reached by a forty-minute ride in a fast train
    from London. It stands high on the hills overlooking a beautiful
    valley, the shipping of Chatham and the Rochester Cathedral.
    However, Borstal means much more than a local institution, for
    it has given its name to a system of treatment during and after
    confinement which has been so extraordinarily successful that
    a modification of it is being practiced in nearly all British
    prisons for both sexes. Unfortunately, I chose a Saturday for my
    visit and as a sort of half-holiday is practiced there my view of
    the different departments in operation was necessarily hurried,
    and I cannot do better than give you, as much in his own words as
    possible, the description given me by Thomas Holmes a day or two
    before I made my visit.

    In this place, since 1903, the Prison Commissioners have conducted
    experiments with regard to young male prisoners from which they
    have evolved the system to which the old prison has given its name.

    “In reality, it is an attempt by the State, to rescue young persons
    from a life of crime and fit them for an honest industrial life.
    It is unnecessary to point out the value of such work nor to
    say that it is a new departure from the ordinary aims of penal
    administration.

    “Of course there were many difficulties in the way and the Prison
    Commissioners found themselves hampered by lack of funds; the State
    being chary in giving requisite support. But in 1908 the system,
    having proved abundantly successful, became part and parcel of the
    penal system of the country and in 1909 prisons dealing only with
    the young offenders between the ages of 16 and 21 became Borstal
    institutions.

    “Now a word in explanation of the method of selecting the inmates
    and their treatment. In 1908 the prevention of Crimes Act was
    passed, several clauses of which dealt with the reformation of
    young offenders. That they may be perfectly understood, they are
    given in full:

    “Where a person is convicted on indictment for an offense for
    which he is liable to be sent to penal servitude or imprisonment
    and it appears to the Court, first, that the person is not less
    than 16 nor more than 21 years of age, and second, that by reason
    of his criminal tendencies or habits, or association with persons
    of bad character, it is expedient that he should be subject to
    detention for such a term and under such instruction and discipline
    as appears most conducive to his reformation and the repression
    of crime, it should be lawful for the Court, in lieu of passing a
    sentence of penal servitude, or imprisonment, to pass a sentence
    of detention under penal discipline in the Borstal institution for
    a term not less than one year and not more than three years; and
    for the purpose of this act the Secretary of State may establish
    Borstal Institutions, that is to say, places where young offenders
    may be given, while under detention, industrial training and
    instruction.

    “This Act also gives power to the Prison Commissioners to discharge
    on license, such offenders as they think fitted for conditional
    liberty, but no license can be granted until the offender has
    served at least six months of his sentence and every offender
    whether he is released on license or has served his complete
    sentence, remains after his discharge under the supervision of the
    Prison Commissioners for several months.

    “Another part of this Act provides that young offenders sentenced
    to the Borstal treatment must be of good physical and mental health
    and further provides that young men, up to the age of 23 may now be
    admitted to Borstal institutions.”

    Having explained the Genesis of the Borstal institution and given
    you an idea of the class of young men who are admitted to them,
    it will be well to give some details of the daily life therein.
    The Borstalian, on his arrival is bathed and given his uniform and
    the Warden who receives him reads him the rules and gives him any
    necessary information. Next morning he sees the Chaplain and is
    examined by the Doctor and finally brought before the Governor. All
    his antecedents and capabilities are inquired into; his education,
    knowledge, trades, his tastes, etc., are carefully tabulated and
    everything, little though it be, is taken note of for the purposes
    of guiding the Authorities in directing the young man’s future.
    Thus, if he has any knowledge of a trade and wishes to continue
    it he is put straight at it; if he has none, but appears a likely
    youth for a certain job, he is put to that job at once.

    “Should he be an ignorant and hopeless kind of youth for whom
    training and discipline, smartness, etc. is necessary, he is put
    among those who do the housecleaning, etc., where he must work
    neatly, and be quick. Every Borstalian gets physical drill every
    morning for one-half hour and one hour’s gymnasium three times a
    week when no fooling is allowed, for whether it be physical drill
    or gymnastics, work or play, he must do his share, perform all
    the exercises, every one of which has been carefully planned for
    developing his physical and mental smartness.

    “Education is not forgotten, for no sooner does he join the
    institution than he begins to receive five hours tuition each week;
    nor is he released from this until he can pass examinations which
    prove him able to read with comparative ease, write intelligibly
    and do simple figuring. Even then further education awaits him,
    for special classes are formed on various subjects and lectures
    on all topics are given in a large hall where he goes when his
    behaviour and progress have been satisfactory. As magic lanterns
    are frequently used to illustrate these lectures, you can readily
    believe that these prove a great attraction.

    “But the life at Borstal is not all work and no play for the Prison
    Commissioners have recognized that if a youth must work well it is
    essential that he play well, so recreation has not been forgotten.
    After five months a youth of behaviour and industry can obtain
    entrance to a special class and on three evenings in the week may
    meet with others, to play, to read and on Saturday afternoons may
    take part in football or cricket as the season serves.

    “It will be seen that work, education and play all have a part in
    the life at Borstal but religion is not forgotten and I know of no
    religious service more impressive than some of those I have taken
    part in at this institution.

    “Here is the programme of the daily life at the institution. At
    5:30 the prisoner arises and begins the day with a biscuit and
    milk after which he cleans and tidies up his cell. At 7 o’clock he
    breakfasts on bread, porridge, margarine and with tea and coffee,
    if he is in the special grade. At 7:30 he is in the workshop or in
    the open; and carpentering, blacksmithing, bootmaking, building,
    gardening, cooking, cleaning, or laundry work, occupy him until
    noon, when dinner, consisting of bread, meat, potatoes and pudding
    await him. After an hour and ten minutes for dinner and rest he
    resumes work which continues until 5:30 when work ceases and there
    is a general parade reviewed by the Governor after which he gets
    his last food for the day, generally consisting of bread and cheese
    and a mug of cocoa.

    “At 6:15 there is a general meeting in the Chapel when short
    addresses are given by the Chaplain and others and encouraging
    letters from discharged boys who are doing well are read. Then they
    go to the evening classes after which there is recreation for a few
    moments until 8:30 when they go to their cells and shortly after
    lights are out.”

    Surely this is a sensible day’s programme, a sensible system and
    well applied. There are some faults in the plant but as the system
    grew from a very small beginning and the buildings were added from
    time to time this criticism is harsh. However, different planning
    would greatly facilitate the training and decrease the cost of
    maintenance. There are some in the system which are in process of
    being remedied. For instance, it is proposed to lengthen the period
    of licensed freedom to at least one year so that each boy can prove
    himself without need of care during the four seasons.

    The care given these discharged Borstalians, either on license
    or having served their full time, is most admirable. They are in
    charge of the Borstal Association whose agents, aided by those of
    over 60 County Societies for the aid of discharged prisoners, have
    an eye, a very watchful eye, upon them and who report frequently to
    the Association, and a glance at their records, absolutely the most
    complete, concise and convenient imaginable, one can be familiar
    with the whole history of any individual. These records show,
    among multitudinous other things, that aid is frequently required
    to establish a boy as a self-supporting, self-respecting member
    of decent society. It is seldom more than assistance in procuring
    work, or a heart-to-heart “big brother” talk.

    I wish every member of our committee could see these records.
    Besides their primary function of recording they furnish a
    wonderfully interesting human document, and a first-class text-book
    on crime causes, the chances for reformation of different
    characters, etc., etc., all based on the observation of the
    individual, not when under restraint, but when, comparatively
    speaking, a free agent.

    Such records would have an incalculable value to us, if carefully
    kept by the Authorities or Prison Associations of the different
    States. In many places we are applying new systems, or old systems
    to new conditions. New problems are almost bound to arise, as the
    hordes of immigrants, reaching our shores daily, have their effect
    on the national type, and without exact data as to the cause of
    the failure of any system little can be done to better it, and a
    better weapon to induce legislation, not to speak of individual and
    corporate assistance in our work, would be hard to imagine.

    What is called the full Borstal system has not been practiced long
    enough for some to consider it a proven success, but the figures
    here given, those for prisoners released in 1909, give cause for
    bright hopes at least.

    174 are at present conducting themselves satisfactorily, that is,
    82 per cent.

    2 are on hand, that is, as yet without permanent work.

    2 are dead.

    18 are unsatisfactory, irregular at work through their own fault.

    1 is lost sight of, but there is no reason to think for evil.

    15 have been re-convicted, all but one of which have refused two or
    more chances to work at fair wages.

If 82 per cent. of our offenders were reformed our prisons would be
certainly a good investment, but it is only fair to remember that not
all convicted youths between 16 and 23, and no adults of any sort,
are brought under this treatment. Delicate or defective physique of
any sort makes it impossible. How to make a cripple or a boy with a
weak heart into a self-supporting man within the limits of the short
sentence such unfortunates usually receive, is very hard to see. It is
too short a time to learn a trade and even the English authorities are
ridiculously hampered by laws preventing convict labor excepting upon
articles for State use, so that what is learned at prison is of little
value out of it....

The inspectors report the completion of a new building containing 120
cells, for which the last Legislature appropriated $60,000.00. The
actual cost was $52,698.11, and the balance of the appropriation has
been turned over to the Treasury of the State. “In the erection of the
building, no other than the labor of the prisoners was employed.” They
also state that the results of the application of the Parole Law have
been very satisfactory.

WESTERN PENITENTIARY.


The site for the Western Penitentiary of Pennsylvania has been
officially chosen by Warden John Francies and the Board of Prison
Inspectors. The selection of the site is subject to the approval
of Gov. John K. Tener, and is in Center County, a few miles from
Bellefonte. It contains 4,878 acres of fertile agricultural land, 936
acres being part of a State forestry reservation, the rest, 3,942
acres, being held under option from a number of private landowners. The
cost of the private land will be $191,655.

From the forest reservation ample wood for the construction of
preliminary buildings of the new prison may be drawn. The institution
will be entirely fireproof, and it is Warden Francies’ intention to
have all the manual labor entailed in its construction done by his
wards.

From McBride’s Gap, which forms a cleft in Nittany Mountain, will be
drawn the new prison’s water supply. Warden Francies has obtained the
entire watershed of McBride’s Gap Run, giving the prison absolute
control of the sanitary condition of the drainage area. A beautiful
roaring spring of sparkling water descends from the Gap, which has a
minimum flow of 600,000 gallons of water per twenty-four hours. The
water in McBride’s Gap is of a high degree of purity. The sanitary
condition of the watershed, as found by engineers employed by Mr.
Francies, is excellent.

It is Warden Francies’ intention to construct a huge reservoir, which
will store about 70,000,000 gallons of water. Pressure will be at
command at all times to amply operate the mechanical and industrial
departments of the prison and meet the requirements of many homes which
will be built by the State for the officers of the new prison.

In view of the fact that each of the farms embraced by the Nittany
Mountain site is improved with farm houses in good state of repair,
barns and other outbuildings, that the properties are well fenced,
drained, and most of them have matured orchards, the average price per
acre paid by the State for the twenty-two farms is considered to be
remarkably cheap.

REPORTS OF COUNTY JAILS IN PENNSYLVANIA.


Apparently very few counties in the State of Pennsylvania issue
published reports.

In response to a request from the Society, we have received reports
from 9 County Jails, from which we present the following items:


LUZERNE COUNTY--Wilkes-Barre.

  Number of prisoners received during the year 1911        1788
  Number on hand Dec. 31st, 1911                            104
  Average number per day                                    132½
  Cost per day for boarding prisoners                  12 3-5 cents
  Number employed out of their cells                         42

Those employed at this jail make and repair shoes, weave stockings and
make mattresses. The prison conducts a regular system of daily school
instruction.

Daily attendance at the school 21.

They are instructed in spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic and
history.

“There was no serious breach of the rules and no punishment inflicted,
or no attempt made to escape during the year.”

“The stern hand of the law must control a man by force, but the
law above finds a tender spot in the heart. Appeals to the reason
constrains him to choose the path of righteousness.”


CAMBRIA COUNTY--Ebensburg.

Report covers the time from March 7th, 1911, to Jan. 1st, 1912.

In that time they had received 547. Number in prison Jan. 1st, 1912,
112.

A number of improvements were made in the prison during the year, but
many more improvements are needed in order to secure proper ventilation
and sanitation.


LEHIGH COUNTY--Allentown.

  Number committed in 1911                             1123
  Number in prison Dec. 31st, 1911                      122
  Cost of board for each prisoner per day       10.83 cents

The main industry appears to be the manufacture of carpets and striped
clothing.

Gospel services are conducted weekly.


DAUPHIN COUNTY--Harrisburg.

No report received for 1911.

  In 1910, the number committed was       6,373
  The number Dec. 31st, 1910, was           215

With the exception of some domestic services, no industries appear to
be maintained at this institution.


ALLEGHENY COUNTY--Pittsburg.

  Number received during 1911                               14,302
  Number in prison Dec. 31st, 1911                             380
  Average number of prisoners each day                         412
  Average cost per day for food for each prisoner       6.22 cents


ALLEGHENY COUNTY WORKHOUSE--Hoboken.

  Number of prisoners received during the year 1911       4,171
  Number in prison at end of year                           827
  Average daily cost per inmate                     41.91 cents
  Average cost, after deducting earnings            19.01 cents
  Average inmates employed per day                          535
  Average inmates unemployed per day                        301

The sources of revenue are from the manufacture of brooms, brushes,
carpets, and from the sale of farm produce, and also from boarding
prisoners received from counties outside of Allegheny County.

Of the 4,171 received during the year, 2,237 were committed for the
first time. There were six who had been committed each fifty times or
more.

The shortest sentence was 10 days; the longest, 7 years.

2,366 were sentenced for 30 days, a very common sentence.

A night school is conducted for the benefit of illiterates, of whom 552
were received last year.

The chaplain in his report suggests that reformation would be much
aided if there should be organized at Pittsburg some society with
object to have the care of released prisoners.


MONTGOMERY COUNTY--Norristown.

  Report for 1910--Total committed during 1911        1156
  Number in prison at close of the year                147

“The night school conducted by the Society of Friends has taught many
inmates to read and write.”


DELAWARE COUNTY--Media.

A very brief report received.

  Amount spent for tobacco for the prisoners                    $369.00


MONTOUR COUNTY--Danville.

  Number committed during the year                                  54
  Number in jail at close of the year ending Sept. 30th, 1911        2


LANCASTER COUNTY--Lancaster.

  Number of prisoners received during 1911            1,324

  Number of chairs caned                                379




PRISONERS’ AID SOCIETIES.

Some few months ago, the Secretary of the PENNSYLVANIA PRISON
SOCIETY sent to various Prisoners’ Aid Societies in the United
States a series of inquiries relative to the character of the aid
furnished by them to discharged prisoners.

A summary of these reports will prove interesting.


MASSACHUSETTS SOCIETY FOR AIDING DISCHARGED CONVICTS.

“This Society has furnished at one time or another to discharged
prisoners almost everything from clothing to artificial legs, eyes,
teeth, crutches, medicines, tools, jobs, transportation, board, etc.”

Their assistance is given not so much to those who are discharged from
the Penitentiary as to those who have served time in the County Jails.

“Where a man is employed in some special occupation, he needs extra
clothing, such as waiter’s outfit, rubber boots for sea, overalls,
etc., and where he is needy, change of underwear, socks, extra shirt,
etc. We furnish these articles. Last year, about $1800 was expended by
me for clothing out of a total expenditure of $9,479.10.”


MAINE PRISON ASSOCIATION.

This Association has been recently formed and so far its activities
have been directed to interesting the public and securing more
effective penal legislation.

There is a Prison Society at Portland, Maine, which gives help to
prisoners discharged from the County Jail. The clothing is solicited
and no money is paid except for expenses of lodging and transportation.


PRISONERS’ AID ASSOCIATION, RHODE ISLAND.

Their object is “to aid discharged prisoners in such ways and by
such means as will enable them to gain an honest and respectable
livelihood,” and also “to adopt such measures as shall seem to be
conducive to the prevention of crime.” For the present their efforts
are chiefly directed to the maintenance of a temporary Industrial Home
for released women prisoners. In 1910 their care extended to seventy
women and eight children.


PRISON ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK.

This Association furnishes prisoners when discharged from the County
Prisons with clothing if they are in need. The applicant makes personal
request for help at their offices. The Association does not maintain an
Agent at the County Prison with purpose of determining what clothing
is necessary to be supplied. The Association solicits contributions of
clothing to be given to deserving ex-prisoners. They make a specialty
of caring for those who have been paroled and for those who have been
on probation. Their report last year shows an income of about $20,000,
of which $1,000 may have been used for clothing.


THE WOMEN’S PRISON ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK CITY.

This Society has an Agent whose sole business it is to keep in close
touch with all the women who have been arrested and taken to the
sixty-eight station houses in the city where women are admitted.

“The Isaac T. Hopper Home, under our care, is not a prison; those
admitted are expected to give a month’s service, at the end of which
time they are sent to service in private families; a few remain from
choice, and to some of these low wages are paid. During the month of
trial, they are not expected to go out. The atmosphere of the house is
cheerful; they have good beds and good food.”


CONNECTICUT PRISON ASSOCIATION.

The suit, shoes and hat are furnished by the prison authorities. This
Association furnishes under-clothing and overcoats to those discharged
from the State Prison. In 1909-1910, they expended for this purpose
$1,051. We believe this Association gets an appropriation from the
State amounting to $2500 per annum. They assist in the “Parole Work.”


PRISON LEAGUE OF AMERICA.

This organization, under the efficient control of Maud Ballington
Booth, in results attained, stands at the head of all Prisoners’ Aid
Societies. To all ex-prisoners who apply they give clothing, work and
good cheer. In Chicago they have at this time assumed sponsorship for
nearly 300 prisoners.

“The clothing part of it is only a small part of the much we do, but it
is often the very necessary part.”

In various parts of the country this Society maintains farms, at which
work is given to ex-prisoners, and where they are assisted in every way
on the road to reform.


PRISON GATE MISSION, SALVATION ARMY, NEW YORK CITY.

“Good substantial clothing is given us from time to time that generally
meets the needs of the people with whom we deal.”

They maintain industrial homes at which the opportunity is given to
labor for their best welfare. They are doing wonderful work, the
importance of which defies statistics. They are not directly connected
with the “Parole Work.”


SOCIETY FOR THE FRIENDLESS.

This organization appears to have headquarters in Kansas City,
Missouri, with branch associations in various states. The Gen. Supt. is
Rev. Edward A. Fredenhagen, Kansas City, Mo., to whom applications for
further information may be sent. As a rule, prisoners discharged from
city prisons, jails, lock-ups, etc., are not supplied with clothing,
and when they apply to the Society for the Friendless their wants are
supplied and an effort is made to furnish them with employment. The
organization endeavors to follow them up and to keep in touch with
those whom they have helped. They endeavor to co-operate with Parole
Officers, but are not officially connected with the work. Societies
of the same name, mostly branches of the organization at Kansas City,
Mo., have made similar responses from North Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky,
Montana, Iowa, Washington and Minnesota.

Superintendent Parsons of the Minnesota Division says that last year
in pursuance of their work they “traveled 26,714 miles, delivered 265
addresses to 42,870 people, made 176 jail visits, interviewed 1110
prisoners.... Places of employment have been found for 120, and a large
number more have found employment as the result of the care given them.”


NEBRASKA PRISON ASSOCIATION.

The Legislature of this State appropriates $5,000 to supply the
needs of prisoners discharged from Penitentiary, and the work of
administering this charity appears to be undertaken by this Association.


PRISON REFORM ASSOCIATION OF LOUISIANA.

They furnish needy prisoners when discharged from county jails with
clothing. Up to this time they are not connected with “Parole Work.”


PRISON ASSOCIATION OF GEORGIA.

This organization has been organized but a few months, and has not
undertaken to distribute clothing to needy prisoners. They are
endeavoring to promote “Parole Work” and agree to employ any prisoner
who is entitled to “Parole.”


PRISONERS’ AID ASSOCIATION OF MARYLAND.

When prisoners come to them from the jails and appear to be in need,
they supply them with clothing. They are connected with the work of
paroling prisoners, and endeavor to follow them up by a system of
visitation.


THE CENTRAL HOWARD ASSOCIATION; CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

“In reply to your first question, would say that in all of the eight
states in which this Association operates, the State itself furnishes
a suit of clothes, including an overcoat in winter, to all released
prisoners except in Kentucky, when men are paroled they do not receive
clothing. In addition a discharge fee of from $5 to $10 is given them
to make a new start. In one state, Minnesota, this discharge money
amounts to $25. Your second question is, therefore, answered by stating
that this Association is not called upon to furnish clothing and does
not spend any funds for that purpose. In the case of all those who come
to us from the Cook County Jail and the Chicago House of Correction,
and do not receive clothing or discharge money, we sometimes fit
them out with better clothing, but this is usually cast off clothing
given to us by friends.” * * * * “In answer to question five, would
state that we are directly connected with the ‘Parole Work’ in this
and adjacent states. In the case of those who are entitled to parole
in Illinois and are without friends or employers to sign their first
papers, these papers are signed by me in many cases, and I keep the men
under supervision during the period of their parole and they report
through me to the officials. In the cases of adjoining states, except
where the law permits them to be paroled outside of the state line, we
secure employers who are residents of that state to sign the parole
papers and serve as ‘first friend’ to the prisoner. This Association
also furnishes a representative in connection with the Adult Probation
Law to work with the paid Probation Officers in the courts in carrying
out the provisions of said law.”


COLORADO PRISON ASSOCIATION.

They formerly furnished prisoners when discharged from the Penitentiary
with clothing, but after securing the passage of a law, whereby the
State provides such clothing, they no longer assume such expense. In
the “Parole Work” they endeavor to co-operate with the Wardens. Their
Field Secretary visits the jails throughout the State.


HOME OF INDUSTRY, PHILADELPHIA.

“Grand object--the founding and providing of a Retreat and Home for
Discharged Prisoners of the City of Philadelphia, and the State of
Pennsylvania, giving employment and compensation for labor performed,
and by moral and religious influences and surroundings to awaken in
them an incentive to true manliness and good citizenship....”

Last year 79 men were received in the Home who were supplied with board
and lodging, and for services received some wages. They were assisted
in securing situations for permanent employment. The State recognizes
their good efforts by making an appropriation of $2500.00 per annum for
maintenance.


DOOR OF BLESSING, PHILADELPHIA.

This Institution has been in existence about 11 years, and in that time
has taken charge of 357 women and 30 children. These women and children
come to them from either the State of City prisons.

Many of them are forwarded to their homes, and situations for others
are obtained in the country. Recently, through the Agent of The
Pennsylvania Prison Society, they receive many children who have been
arrested for vagrancy and petty offences, direct from the Magistrates,
and they receive kindly attention until they are restored to their
friends or have been placed in homes.


AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR VISITING CATHOLIC PRISONERS.

The 16th Annual Report of the American Society for visiting Catholic
Prisons, just issued, shows that there were committed to the Eastern
Penitentiary of Pennsylvania in the year 1911, as follows:

  Catholic convicts                  107
  Catholic convicts discharged       113

and that there were remaining in the Penitentiary at the close of the
year (December 31st, 1911)

  Catholic men convicts              428
  Catholic women convicts              6
                                    -----
  Total                              434

The report states that “a committee of the society regularly visits
these unfortunates and seeks to convert the criminals into good
citizens,” and that during the past year 6256 visits were made.

Rev. M. A. Noel, S. J., is Catholic Chaplain of the Penitentiary, and
Mr. P. H. Spellissy is the President of the Society.




PAROLE IN CALIFORNIA

(Our good friend, Col. Griffith, of Los Angeles, sends to us the
following account of splendid results achieved in California.)


“One of the most excellent progressive movements of the period is that
which looks to a reform in the prison system and strives to convert
criminals into good citizens, useful to themselves, their families
and society. Governor Johnson has been a leader of the movement in
California, procuring the enactment of legislation greatly improving
conditions in the penitentiaries of the state. When the new system
shall have been operative for a reasonable period, men who have ‘done
their time’ will re-enter the world possessed of training that will
enable them to maintain themselves in honesty. Many a discharged
criminal relapses into crime because society has so ordered his
punishment as to make reform practically so difficult as to be almost
impossible.

“Eleven per cent. of California’s convicts are under parole. Last
month but five of the 363 violated in any way the terms on which
parole was granted, and every one was at work. During the month they
earned $15,600.55, expended $11,721.08 and saved $3879.47. That is
an excellent record, but its excellence will be greatly increased
under the new industrial methods to be established for the benefit
of the convicts in confinement. They will be taught how to maintain
themselves, and as those teachings become effective and hope, courage
and confidence are revived among men who would be outcast derelicts
were they released now, the percentage released on parole will rise and
the number of the redeemed increase.”

AN ACT.

    To define the rights and functions of official visitors of jails,
    penitentiaries, and other penal or reformatory institutions, and
    providing for their removal.

Section 1. Be it enacted, &c., That any person designated by law to
be official visitor of any jail, penitentiary, or other penal or
reformatory institution, in this Commonwealth, maintained at the public
expense, is hereby authorized and empowered to enter and visit any such
jail, penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory institution, on any
and every day, including Sundays, between the hours of nine o’clock,
ante meridian, and five o’clock, post meridian; and not before nine
o’clock, ante meridian, or after five o’clock, post meridian, except
with the special permission of the warden, manager, overseer, or
superintendent in charge of any such jail, penitentiary, or other penal
or reformatory institution.

Section 2. Upon any such visit of any official visitor to any such
jail, penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory institution, such
visitor shall have the right to interview privately any prisoner
or inmate confined in any such jail, penitentiary, or other penal
reformatory institution, and for that purpose to enter the cell,
room, or apartment wherein any such prisoner or inmate shall be
confined: Provided, however, That if any warden, manager, overseer,
superintendent, or person in charge of such institution at the time of
such visit, shall be of the opinion that such entry by the official
visitor into the cell, room, or apartment of such prisoner or inmate
would be dangerous to the discipline of the institution, then and in
that case the said warden, superintendent, overseer, manager, or person
in charge, may conduct any prisoner or inmate, with whom such official
visitor may desire a private interview, into such other cell, room, or
apartment within the institution as he may designate and there permit
the private interview between the official visitor and such prisoner
or inmate to take place: Provided further, however, That no official
visitor shall have the right or power of privately interviewing any
such prisoner or inmate except prisoners or inmates of the same sex as
such official visitor.

Section 3. All powers, functions, and privileges heretofore belonging
to official visitors of jails, penitentiaries, and penal or reformatory
institutions, under the common statute laws, are hereby confirmed:
Provided, however, That no such official visitor shall have the right
or power to give or deliver to any prisoner or inmate of any such
jail, penitentiary, or penal or reformatory institution, during such
visit, any chattel or object whatsoever, except objects and articles of
religious or moral instruction or use.

Section 4. If any such official visitor shall violate any of the
prohibitions herein contained, any warden, manager, overseer, or
superintendent of any such jail, penitentiary, penal or reformatory
institution, may apply to any court of common pleas in the county
wherein such institution may be situated, for a rule upon such
visitor to show cause why he or she should not be deprived of his or
her office; and upon proof to the satisfaction of said court being
made, such court shall enter a decree against such official visitor,
depriving him or her of all rights, privileges, and functions of
official visitor.

APPROVED--The 14th day of May, A. D. 1909.
